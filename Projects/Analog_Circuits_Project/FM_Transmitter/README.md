# 📡 FM Transmitter Project

## Overview 🚀
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **low-power FM Transmitter** that can wirelessly transmit audio signals (like music or voice) to a nearby FM radio receiver. The core idea is to **modulate** an audio signal onto a **carrier frequency** in the FM band (typically around 88–108 MHz) and **broadcast** it over short distances.

FM transmitters are a great introduction to **analog communication**, **modulation**, and **RF circuit design**.

## 📌 Prerequisites
Before building this project, it’s helpful to understand:
- **Frequency Modulation (FM)**
-**Antenna**
- **Impedance Matching**
- **Power Amplifier**
- **Oscillator Circuits (LC Tank, Colpitts, Hartley)**
- **RF Filtering and Antenna Basics**

## Why I Chose the FM Transmitter 📻
1. **Hands-on RF Learning**: Building an FM transmitter is one of the best DIY projects to understand real-world modulation.
2. **Wireless Audio Transmission**: It’s fun to hear your own voice or music on an FM radio.
3. **Analog Circuit Design**: Involves oscillators, amplifiers, filters, and antennas—all key analog/RF concepts.
4. **Real-World Relevance**: FM is still widely used in broadcast and embedded RF communication (e.g., wireless microphones, remote controls).

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Oscillator**: Generates a high-frequency **carrier wave** (in FM band ~100 MHz) using an LC tank circuit.
2. **Audio Modulation**: An audio signal (e.g., from a phone or mic) **modulates** the frequency of the carrier by altering the reactance of the tank (commonly by varying the capacitance).
3. **Amplification**: The modulated signal is amplified to ensure enough transmission range.
4. **Antenna Transmission**: The RF signal is transmitted via an antenna tuned to the same frequency as the carrier.
