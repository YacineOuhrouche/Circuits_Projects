# 🎹 Simple Digital Piano 

## Overview 🚀  
This project demonstrates how to build a **basic digital piano** using a **555 timer IC** in astable mode. The circuit uses a series of resistors and pushbuttons to generate different musical notes, which are output through a **piezo buzzer**. The circuit was first designed and simulated in **Tinkercad**, then built and tested on a breadboard.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, it helps to have:

- A basic understanding of breadboards and electronic components
- Familiarity with the 555 timer IC and how it works in astable mode
- Basic knowledge of frequency and resistance relationships

## 📚 Why Build a Digital Piano?

Creating a digital piano using a 555 timer is a fantastic way to explore the fundamentals of:

- **Sound generation using electronics**
- **555 timer in astable mode**
- **Tonal frequencies and musical note generation**
- **Basic prototyping and circuit design**

It's a hands-on project that blends **electronics**, **music**, and **logic design**.

## 🔧 How It Works

This piano uses the **astable mode** of the 555 timer to generate tones. The frequency depends on two resistors (RA, RB) and a capacitor (C). In this design:

- RA is fixed at **1kΩ**
- C is fixed at **100nF**
- RB varies depending on which button is pressed

Each pushbutton connects a unique combination of resistors to form the RB value that sets the tone's frequency. The 555 timer outputs a square wave at this frequency, which drives the piezo buzzer to produce a musical note.
