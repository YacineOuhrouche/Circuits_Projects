# 🔁 CMOS Ring Oscillator Project  

## Overview 🧩  
This project demonstrates the design and functionality of a **CMOS Ring Oscillator**, a basic but powerful circuit that converts DC power into a periodic square wave signal. It's widely used for **on-chip clock generation**, **process variation analysis**, and **circuit characterization** in **VLSI design**.

The oscillator consists of an **odd number of CMOS inverters** connected in a loop, causing the signal to continuously toggle and generate a clock-like waveform.

## 📌 Prerequisites  
Before building or analyzing this circuit, it's helpful to understand:  
- ✅ Basics of **MOSFETs** (nMOS and pMOS transistors)  
- ✅ [CMOS Inverter Design](../CMOS_Logic_Gates/CMOS_NOT_Gate)  
- ✅ Basic concept of **oscillators** and **RC time constants**  
- ✅ Propagation delay in logic gates

## 🧠 Why Build a CMOS Ring Oscillator?  
- 🔄 **Self-sustaining clock source**: Generates a square wave without any external clock  
- 🔬 **Delay characterization**: Used to measure the delay of logic gates in a specific process  
- 🧱 **Foundational block**: Often used in PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops), frequency synthesizers, and random number generators  
- 🧪 **CMOS demonstration**: Great example of dynamic behavior in a CMOS circuit

## ⚙️ How It Works  

The CMOS Ring Oscillator is made by connecting an **odd number of inverters** in a closed loop. The signal propagates through each stage, inverting at every step, and due to the **odd number of inversions**, the circuit can never reach a stable state—causing it to oscillate.

### 🧾 Key Concepts:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Odd number of inverters** | Required to sustain oscillation |
| **Propagation delay** | Each inverter introduces a small time delay (τ) |
| **Oscillation frequency** | Inversely proportional to the number of stages and delay:  
   `f ≈ 1 / (2 * N * τ)` |

## 📐 Choosing the Right Configuration  

This project uses a **3-stage ring**, but other odd values like 5, 7, or 9 can also be used.  
- ✅ **More stages** → Lower frequency, smoother waveform  
- ✅ **Fewer stages** → Higher frequency, less delay  

**Note**: Add buffer inverters at the output if you want to drive external logic or measure with instruments.

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- 📏 Measure **frequency vs. supply voltage** (VDD) to analyze behavior  
- 📉 Use **delay elements** between inverters to tune the frequency
