# ðŸ’¾ HDL Digital Design Projects

Welcome to the **HDL Digital Design Projects** repository! ðŸŽ‰  
This collection features fundamental digital circuits implemented in **Verilog HDL**, showcasing how hardware description languages can bring digital logic to life.

Each folder contains:

âœ… A brief explanation of the project  
âœ… A link to more information (where relevant)  
âœ… A schematic or conceptual diagram (where applicable)  
âœ… Full Verilog code and testbenches

## Quick Links to Each Project

| Project | Description | Link |
|--|--|--|
| ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Controller | FSM-based traffic signal system for a 4-way intersection | [Traffic Light Controller Folder](./Traffic_Light_Controller) |
| ðŸ”¢ 4-bit ALU | Performs arithmetic and logic operations on two 4-bit operands | [4-bit ALU Folder](./4_Bit_ALU) |
| ðŸ“¦ 4-bit Register | A simple 4-bit data register with load and reset control | [4-bit Register Folder](./4_Bit_register) |

Verilog is a **hardware description language** that lets us describe the behavior of **digital hardware** using code. It bridges the gap between **logic design** and **physical circuits**, enabling simulation, testing, and synthesis onto real hardware (like FPGAs).
