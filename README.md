📡 Welcome to my **Circuits Collection** repository!

This is where I document circuits I’ve designed and simulated throughout my **Electrical Engineering**  journey.

Each folder contains:

✅ Circuit Schematic (PNG/PDF)  
✅ Simulation Files (LTspice, Falstad, Proteus)  
✅ Explanation (How It Works)
