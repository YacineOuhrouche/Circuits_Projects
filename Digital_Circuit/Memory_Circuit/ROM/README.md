# 📘 **ROM**

## ✨ **Introduction**

**ROM** (Read-Only Memory) circuits are essential components in digital systems. Unlike **RAM**, **ROM** is **non-volatile**, meaning it retains its data even when the power is turned off. **ROM** is primarily used to store firmware or software that does not change during normal operation, such as the system’s boot-up instructions.

This guide provides a detailed explanation of the different types of **ROM circuits**, how they work, their advantages, and their applications in digital systems.

## 🔹 **Types of ROM Circuits**

There are several key types of **ROM** circuits, each suited for different purposes:

- 🔒 **PROM (Programmable ROM)**
- 📝 **EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)**
- 💡 **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)**
- 🖥️ **Flash Memory**

Each type has unique features, uses, and benefits, as detailed below.

## 📌 **🔒 PROM (Programmable ROM)**

🔹 **How It Works**:  
- **🖊️ One-time programmable**: Can be written to only once after manufacturing.
- **🔒 Permanent storage**: Once data is programmed, it cannot be changed.
- **📦 Usage**: Used for applications where the data does not need to change, such as embedded systems or device firmware.

## 📌 **📝 EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)**

🔹 **How It Works**:  
- **🔄 Reprogrammable**: Data can be erased and rewritten after exposure to UV light.
- **📏 Requires UV light**: Erasure and reprogramming require specialized equipment.
- **💡 Usage**: Often used in prototypes, development boards, and systems that need infrequent updates.

## 📌 **💡 EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)**

🔹 **How It Works**:  
- **🔋 Electrically reprogrammable**: Can be rewritten using electrical signals without removing it from the circuit.
- **💾 Retains data without power**: Data is preserved even when power is lost.
- **🔄 Slower write speeds**: Writing data is slower compared to **RAM**.
- **⚙️ Usage**: Used for storing small amounts of configuration data, settings, and firmware in devices.
