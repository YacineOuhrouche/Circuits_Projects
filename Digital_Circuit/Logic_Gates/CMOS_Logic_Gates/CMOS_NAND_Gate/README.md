# 🔗 CMOS NAND Gate Using PMOS & NMOS Transistors

Welcome to the **CMOS NAND Gate** project! This folder contains all the files and documentation needed to design, simulate, and build a **2-input NAND gate** using complementary MOS transistors (CMOS technology).

## 📝 What It Does

A **CMOS NAND gate** outputs **LOW (0)** only when **both inputs are HIGH (1)**.  
In all other cases, the output is **HIGH (1)**.

| A | B | Y (Output) |
|--|--|--|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

## ⚙️ How It Works

This CMOS NAND gate uses:

✅ **Two PMOS transistors** in **parallel** for the pull-up network (to VDD)  
✅ **Two NMOS transistors** in **series** for the pull-down network (to GND)  

### Operation

- If both inputs `A` and `B` are **HIGH**, both NMOS transistors turn **ON** and pull the output **LOW**.
- If either input is **LOW**, at least one PMOS transistor turns **ON** and pulls the output **HIGH**.
- This complementary design ensures low static power consumption and reliable logic switching.
