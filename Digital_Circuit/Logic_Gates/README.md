# 🔌 Logic Gate

Welcome to the Logic Gates in Code repository! 🎉
This collection demonstrates how to build digital circuits using components like logic gates, CMOS circuits, and BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors). Digital circuits are essential in computing and digital communication systems.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup
