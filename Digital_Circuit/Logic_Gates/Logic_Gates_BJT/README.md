# Logic Circuits Using Transistors

Welcome to the **Logic Circuits Using Transistors** repository! ðŸŽ‰  
This folder showcases how basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND) can be **built using transistors** (BJT).

Each folder contains:

âœ… A short explanation of what the gate does  
âœ… A link to more information  
âœ…  A schematic image

## Why Transistors?

Transistors are the core building blocks of logic gates in hardware. Understanding these basic gates is essential for anyone working with electronics, embedded systems, or digital design.
