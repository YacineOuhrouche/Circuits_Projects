# OR Gate Using Transistors

## 📝 What It Does

An **OR gate** is a basic digital logic gate that gives a HIGH (1) output if **any of its inputs** are HIGH (1). It only gives a LOW (0) output when **both inputs** are LOW (0).

## 📊 Truth Table

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

## ⚙️ How It Works with Transistors

This OR gate uses **two NPN transistors** connected in parallel to create the OR functionality:

- When **either input** is HIGH, the corresponding transistor conducts, pulling the output HIGH.
- If **both inputs** are LOW, neither transistor conducts, and the output remains LOW.
