# 🔌 Digital Circuits

Welcome to the **Digital Circuits** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **basic digital circuits** using logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and other digital components. Digital circuits process binary signals, making them essential in computing and digital communication systems.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup
