# ðŸ“˜ Finite State Machines (FSMs)

## âœ¨ Introduction

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are mathematical models used to design systems that have a finite number of states and transition between those states based on inputs. They are widely used in digital systems, control systems, compilers, and more. In this guide, we'll explore the different types of FSMs, how they function, and their uses.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Finite State Machines

There are several main types of FSMs:

1. **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)**
2. **NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton)**
3. **Moore Machine**
4. **Mealy Machine**

Each has its unique behavior and role in digital systems, as explained below.

## ðŸ“Œ DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- In a **DFA**, for every input and every state, there is exactly one transition to a new state. This makes it **deterministic**.
- It is used in systems where the next state is always predictable from the current state and input.

ðŸ“· **Transition Table**:

| State | Input 'a' | Input 'b' | 
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| S0    | S1        | S2        |
| S1    | S1        | S0        |
| S2    | S0        | S2        |

ðŸ“· **Explanation**:
- From **S0**, if 'a' is received, the DFA transitions to **S1**.
- If 'b' is received at **S1**, it goes back to **S0**.

## ðŸ“Œ NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- In an **NFA**, for a given input symbol, there can be multiple possible states the machine can transition to. This makes it **non-deterministic**.
- An NFA can also have **epsilon transitions**, where the machine transitions without any input.

ðŸ“· **Transition Table**:

| State | Input 'a'   | Input 'b'   |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| S0    | {S1, S2}    | {S2}        |
| S1    | {S0}        | {S2}        |
| S2    | {S1}        | {S0, S2}    |

ðŸ“· **Explanation**:
- At **S0**, receiving 'a' can take the machine to either **S1** or **S2**.
- The NFA can be in multiple states at once, allowing more flexibility.

## ðŸ“Œ Moore Machine

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- A **Moore Machine** is a type of FSM where the output depends **only on the current state** and not on the input symbol.
- It is simpler to design but may be less responsive to input changes than a Mealy machine.

ðŸ“· **State Transition Table**:

| Current State | Input 'a' | Input 'b' | Output |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| S0            | S1        | S2        | 0      |
| S1            | S0        | S1        | 1      |
| S2            | S1        | S2        | 0      |

ðŸ“· **Explanation**:
- In a Moore machine, the output is only determined by the state (not the input). For instance, when the machine is in **S0**, it outputs **0** regardless of whether the next input is 'a' or 'b'.

## ðŸ“Œ Mealy Machine

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- A **Mealy Machine** is another type of FSM where the output depends on both the **current state** and the **input symbol**.
- This makes the Mealy machine more responsive to inputs compared to the Moore machine.


ðŸ“· **State Transition Table**:

| Current State | Input 'a' | Input 'b' | Output |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| S0            | S1/1      | S2/0      | 0      |
| S1            | S0/0      | S1/1      | 1      |
| S2            | S1/1      | S2/0      | 0      |

ðŸ“· **Explanation**:
- In a Mealy machine, the output changes based on both the state and the input. For example, from **S0** with input 'a', the machine transitions to **S1** and outputs **1**.
