# ðŸ“˜ Flip-Flops

## âœ¨ Introduction

Flip-flops are crucial **sequential logic circuits** that store a single bit of data. Unlike combinational circuits, flip-flopsâ€™ outputs are influenced by both the current input and the previous state. This characteristic makes them invaluable in devices like memory, registers, and control systems.

In this guide, we'll explore the **different types of flip-flops**, how they function, and their uses.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Flip-Flops

There are four main types of flip-flops:
1. **SR Flip-Flop** (Set-Reset Flip-Flop)
2. **D Flip-Flop** (Data Flip-Flop)
3. **JK Flip-Flop**
4. **T Flip-Flop** (Toggle Flip-Flop)

Each has its unique behavior and role in digital electronics, as explained below.

## ðŸ“Œ SR Flip-Flop (Set-Reset Flip-Flop)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- The **SR flip-flop** uses two inputs: **Set (S)** and **Reset (R)**, along with a **Clock** signal.
- When **S = 1** and **R = 0**, the output **Q** is set to 1.
- When **S = 0** and **R = 1**, the output **Q** is reset to 0.
- An invalid state occurs if both **S** and **R** are 1 at the same time, causing an undefined output.

  ðŸ“· **Truth Table**:

| S  | R  | Clock | Q  | !Q |
|----|----|-------|----|----|
| 0  | 0  | 1     | Q  | !Q |
| 0  | 1  | 1     | 0  | 1  |
| 1  | 0  | 1     | 1  | 0  |
| 1  | 1  | 1     | X  | X  |

## ðŸ“Œ D Flip-Flop (Data Flip-Flop)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- The **D flip-flop** simplifies the SR flip-flop by ensuring **S** and **R** are never 1 simultaneously.
- It has one input, **D** (Data), and a **Clock** signal. On the clockâ€™s rising edge, the flip-flop stores the value of **D**.

  ðŸ“· **Truth Table**:

| D  | Clock | Q  |
|----|-------|----|
| 0  | â†‘     | 0  |
| 1  | â†‘     | 1  |
| X  | 0     | Q  |

## ðŸ“Œ JK Flip-Flop

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- The **JK flip-flop** resolves the undefined state problem of the SR flip-flop by adding two inputs, **J** and **K**.
- It behaves like an SR flip-flop except when **J = 1** and **K = 1**, in which case the output toggles (flips state).

  ðŸ“· **Truth Table**:

| J  | K  | Clock | Q  |
|----|----|-------|----|
| 0  | 0  | â†‘     | Q  |
| 0  | 1  | â†‘     | 0  |
| 1  | 0  | â†‘     | 1  |
| 1  | 1  | â†‘     | !Q |

## ðŸ“Œ T Flip-Flop (Toggle Flip-Flop)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works**:
- The **T flip-flop** has a single input, **T**. When **T = 1**, the output toggles (flips) with every clock pulse.
- When **T = 0**, the output remains unchanged.

  ðŸ“· **Truth Table**:

| T  | Clock | Q  |
|----|-------|----|
| 0  | â†‘     | Q  |
| 1  | â†‘     | !Q |
