# 🔄 Sequential Logic Circuits

Welcome to the **Sequential Logic Circuits** repository! 🎉  
This collection covers **sequential logic circuits**, which are digital circuits where the output depends not only on the current inputs but also on past inputs due to the presence of memory elements.

Sequential circuits are fundamental in **counters, registers, memory units, and control systems**. Unlike combinational circuits, they use elements like **flip-flops** and **latches** to store state information.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or implementation

## 📌 Understanding Sequential Circuits
Sequential circuits are categorized into two types:

1️⃣ **Synchronous Sequential Circuits** – Operate based on a **clock signal** to synchronize state changes. (e.g., Flip-Flops, Counters, Registers)  
2️⃣ **Asynchronous Sequential Circuits** – Change states immediately based on input changes, without a clock signal. (e.g., Latches)
