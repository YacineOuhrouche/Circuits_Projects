# ⚖️ **Comparator: A Comprehensive Guide**

## ✨ **Introduction**
A **Comparator** is a **combinational logic circuit** that compares two binary values and determines their relationship. It checks whether one value is **greater than**, **less than**, or **equal to** the other. Comparators are crucial in **arithmetic logic units (ALUs)**, **digital control systems**, and **decision-making circuits**.

Comparators are used to enable conditional operations like sorting, threshold detection, and branching.

### **Common Types of Comparators**:
- **1-bit Comparator** → Compares two 1-bit inputs
- **2-bit Comparator** → Compares two 2-bit binary numbers
- **4-bit Comparator** → Compares two 4-bit binary numbers

## 📌 **1-bit Comparator**

### 🔹 **How It Works:**
Compares two 1-bit inputs `A` and `B`.

### 📷 **Truth Table**:

| A | B | A > B | A = B | A < B |
|---|---|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |   1    |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   0    |   0    |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |   0    |   0    |
| 1 | 1 |   0    |   1    |   0    |
