# ⚖️ **Comparator: A Comprehensive Guide**

## ✨ **Introduction**
A **Comparator** is a **combinational logic circuit** that compares two binary values and determines their relationship. It checks whether one value is **greater than**, **less than**, or **equal to** the other. Comparators are crucial in **arithmetic logic units (ALUs)**, **digital control systems**, and **decision-making circuits**.

Comparators are used to enable conditional operations like sorting, threshold detection, and branching.

### **Common Types of Comparators**:
- **1-bit Comparator** → Compares two 1-bit inputs
- **2-bit Comparator** → Compares two 2-bit binary numbers
- **4-bit Comparator** → Compares two 4-bit binary numbers
- **Magnitude Comparator** → Outputs three signals: A > B, A = B, A < B

## 📌 **1-bit Comparator**

### 🔹 **How It Works:**
Compares two 1-bit inputs `A` and `B`.

### 📷 **Truth Table**:

| A | B | A > B | A = B | A < B |
|---|---|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |   1    |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   0    |   0    |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |   0    |   0    |
| 1 | 1 |   0    |   1    |   0    |

## 📌 **2-bit Comparator**

### 🔹 **How It Works:**
Compares two 2-bit binary numbers `A1A0` and `B1B0`.

### 📷 **Example Conditions**:
- If `A1 > B1` → A > B  
- If `A1 = B1` and `A0 > B0` → A > B  
- If `A1 = B1` and `A0 = B0` → A = B  
- If `A1 < B1` or `A1 = B1` and `A0 < B0` → A < B

## 📌 **4-bit Comparator**

### 🔹 **How It Works:**
Compares two 4-bit binary numbers `A3A2A1A0` and `B3B2B1B0`.

### 📷 **Logic:**
- Uses **cascaded 1-bit comparators** or dedicated **4-bit magnitude comparator ICs** like **7485**.
- Outputs: `A > B`, `A = B`, `A < B`

## 📌 **Summary Table**

| Comparator Type  | Inputs        | Outputs                     |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1-bit Comparator | A, B          | A > B, A = B, A < B          |
| 2-bit Comparator | A1A0, B1B0    | A > B, A = B, A < B          |
| 4-bit Comparator | A3–A0, B3–B0  | A > B, A = B, A < B          |
