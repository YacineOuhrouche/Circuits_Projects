# üìò Multiplexer ‚Äì A Comprehensive Guide

## ‚ú® Introduction
A **Multiplexer (MUX)** is a combinational logic circuit that selects one of many input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. It plays a crucial role in **data routing, communication systems, memory addressing, and reducing the number of data paths**.

The number of inputs to a multiplexer is determined by the number of **selection lines (n)**, with the following formula:

- The number of inputs \( N = 2^n \), where \( n \) is the number of selection lines. This allows the multiplexer to exponentially scale with the number of selection lines.

### Common Multiplexer Types:
- **2:1 MUX** ‚Üí 2 inputs, 1 selection line
- **4:1 MUX** ‚Üí 4 inputs, 2 selection lines
- **8:1 MUX** ‚Üí 8 inputs, 3 selection lines
- **16:1 MUX** ‚Üí 16 inputs, 4 selection lines

Multiplexers are commonly used to route data in communication systems, select memory locations, and in arithmetic circuits for choosing different operations.

## üìå 2:1 Multiplexer

üîπ **How It Works:**
- A **single selection line (S)** is used to choose between **two input signals (I‚ÇÄ, I‚ÇÅ)**.
- If the selection line is **0**, input **I‚ÇÄ** is selected; if **1**, input **I‚ÇÅ** is selected.
  
This is the simplest form of a multiplexer and is used when only two data lines need to be routed to a single output.

üì∑ **Truth Table:**

| S  | Output Y |
|----|----------|
| 0  | I‚ÇÄ       |
| 1  | I‚ÇÅ       |

## üìå 4:1 Multiplexer

üîπ **How It Works:**
- A **4:1 multiplexer** uses **two selection lines (S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÅ)** to choose between **four inputs (I‚ÇÄ - I‚ÇÉ)**.
- The selection lines decide the output as follows:
  - **S‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 00** selects **I‚ÇÄ**
  - **S‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 01** selects **I‚ÇÅ**
  - **S‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 10** selects **I‚ÇÇ**
  - **S‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 11** selects **I‚ÇÉ**

This type of multiplexer allows the routing of four input signals to a single output based on the combination of the selection lines.

üì∑ **Truth Table:**

| S‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÄ | Output Y |
|----|----|----------|
| 0  | 0  | I‚ÇÄ       |
| 0  | 1  | I‚ÇÅ       |
| 1  | 0  | I‚ÇÇ       |
| 1  | 1  | I‚ÇÉ       |

## üìå 8:1 Multiplexer

üîπ **How It Works:**
- A **8:1 multiplexer** uses **three selection lines (S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÅ, S‚ÇÇ)** to choose between **eight inputs (I‚ÇÄ - I‚Çá)**.
- The selection lines are mapped to the inputs as follows:
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 000** selects **I‚ÇÄ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 001** selects **I‚ÇÅ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 010** selects **I‚ÇÇ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 011** selects **I‚ÇÉ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 100** selects **I‚ÇÑ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 101** selects **I‚ÇÖ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 110** selects **I‚ÇÜ**
  - **S‚ÇÇS‚ÇÅS‚ÇÄ = 111** selects **I‚Çá**

With 8 input lines, this type of multiplexer is useful in applications where multiple data channels need to be multiplexed into a single data line.

üì∑ **Truth Table:**

| S‚ÇÇ | S‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÄ | Output Y |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | I‚ÇÄ       |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | I‚ÇÅ       |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | I‚ÇÇ       |
| 0  | 1  | 1  | I‚ÇÉ       |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | I‚ÇÑ       |
| 1  | 0  | 1  | I‚ÇÖ       |
| 1  | 1  | 0  | I‚ÇÜ       |
| 1  | 1  | 1  | I‚Çá       |

## üìå 16:1 Multiplexer

üîπ **How It Works:**
- A **16:1 multiplexer** uses **four selection lines (S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÅ, S‚ÇÇ, S‚ÇÉ)** to choose between **16 inputs (I‚ÇÄ - I‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ)**.
- The selection lines determine which input is routed to the output, with the pattern expanding to accommodate all 16 input combinations.

This type of multiplexer is used for high-volume data selection, often found in high-speed data routing applications and systems with large data sets.
