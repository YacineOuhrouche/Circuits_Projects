# 🎚️ Filters Overview

Welcome to the **Filters Repository**! 🎉  
This section explores **two major types of filters** in electronics: **Passive Filters** and **Active Filters**.

## 🌐 What is a Filter?

A **filter** is a circuit designed to **allow or block specific frequency ranges** from a signal.  
Filters are **essential in audio, RF communication, power supplies, and biomedical electronics.**

## 📊 Types of Filters

| Filter Type | Description | Example Filters | Power Source Needed? |
|--|--|--|--|
| Passive Filters | Made only with resistors, capacitors, and inductors | LPF, HPF, BPF, BSF | ❌ No |
| Active Filters | Includes amplifiers (op-amps) to enhance performance | LPF, HPF, BPF, BSF | ✅ Yes |

## 🧰 Key Differences: Passive vs Active Filters

| Aspect | Passive Filters | Active Filters |
|--|--|--|
| Components | Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors | Resistors, Capacitors, Op-Amps |
| Power Supply | Not Required | Required |
| Gain | Cannot amplify signal | Can amplify signal |
| Performance | Less flexible | Highly flexible (adjustable gain, bandwidth) |
| Size | Often larger (inductors) | Usually smaller (IC op-amps) |
| Cost | Cheaper | Slightly more expensive |
