# ⚡ Overvoltage Protection Circuits – A Comprehensive Guide

## ✨ Introduction  
Overvoltage protection circuits are **essential** in electronic systems to prevent voltage spikes from damaging sensitive components. These circuits **limit or divert excessive voltage** away from critical parts, ensuring device safety and longevity.  

### 🔹 Why Use Overvoltage Protection?
✅ **Prevents Component Damage** – Protects ICs, microcontrollers, and power supplies.  
✅ **Enhances System Reliability** – Ensures circuits function within safe voltage limits.  
✅ **Prevents Electrical Failures** – Shields against surges caused by switching transients, lightning strikes, and unstable power sources.

## 📌 Zener Diode Voltage Clamping

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **Zener diode** is connected **in reverse bias** across the load.
- When voltage exceeds the **Zener breakdown voltage**, the diode **conducts**, clamping the voltage at a safe level.
- Excess energy is dissipated through the **series resistor**.

## 📌 TVS Diode Surge Protection

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) diode** absorbs high-energy voltage spikes.
- It rapidly switches to a **low-impedance state**, safely diverting excess voltage to ground.
- Unlike Zener diodes, TVS diodes respond **within nanoseconds**.

## 📌 Crowbar Overvoltage Protection

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Uses a **Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR)** and a **Zener diode**.
- When voltage exceeds the threshold, the **Zener diode** triggers the **SCR**, shorting the circuit.
- This forces the fuse to **blow**, fully disconnecting the power source.
