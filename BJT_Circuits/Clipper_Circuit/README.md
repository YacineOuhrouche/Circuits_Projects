# ðŸ“˜ Clipper Circuits â€“ A Comprehensive Guide

## âœ¨ Introduction
Clipper circuits are electronic circuits used to remove or "clip" portions of an AC signal without distorting the remaining waveform. They are commonly used in wave shaping applications, signal processing, and over-voltage protection.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Clipper Circuits
Clipper circuits can be classified based on the placement of the diode and additional components:

1. **Series Clipper Circuits**
   - Series Positive Clipper
   - Series Negative Clipper
2. **Parallel Clipper Circuits**
   - Parallel Positive Clipper
   - Parallel Negative Clipper
3. **Biased Clipper Circuits**
   - Positive Biased Clipper
   - Negative Biased Clipper
4. **Combination Clippers**
   - Dual-Diode Clippers
   - Transistor Clippers

## ðŸ“Œ Series Clipper Circuits
### ðŸ”¹ 1. Series Positive Clipper
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**



ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- The diode is connected in **series** with the load.
- During the **positive half-cycle**, the diode is **forward biased** and conducts, allowing the signal to pass.
- During the **negative half-cycle**, the diode is **reverse biased**, and the voltage is clipped.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Series Negative Clipper
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**



ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- Works **opposite** to the positive clipper.
- The **negative** half of the input waveform is **clipped off**.
- The diode is **reverse biased** during the **positive cycle**, allowing it to pass.
- The diode **conducts** during the **negative cycle**, blocking the negative signal.

## ðŸ“Œ Parallel Clipper Circuits
### ðŸ”¹ 3. Parallel Positive Clipper
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**


ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- The diode is **in parallel** with the output load.
- During the **positive half-cycle**, the diode conducts and acts as a **short circuit**, clipping the signal.
- During the **negative half-cycle**, the diode is **reverse biased** and does not interfere.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Parallel Negative Clipper
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**



ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- Works **opposite** to the positive parallel clipper.
- The **negative** portion of the waveform is clipped.
- The diode is **reverse biased** during the **positive cycle**, allowing the signal to pass.
- The diode conducts during the **negative cycle**, shorting it.

## ðŸ“Œ Biased Clipper Circuits
### ðŸ”¹ 5. Positive Biased Clipper
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**



ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **DC bias voltage** is added in series with the diode.
- Only signals **above a certain voltage** get clipped.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Negative Biased Clipper
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- Similar to the **positive biased** clipper but clips the **negative portion**.

## ðŸ“Œ Transistor Clippers
Apart from **diode-based** clippers, **transistors** can also be used for precise clipping.

ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**



ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- Uses **BJT or MOSFET transistors** to regulate the signal.
- Can achieve **more precise clipping**.
