# ‚ö° Schmitt Trigger Using Op-Amps

A **Schmitt Trigger** is an essential circuit that converts noisy or slow analog signals into a clean digital output by using **hysteresis**. When implemented with an **operational amplifier (op-amp)**, it functions as a comparator with positive feedback, ensuring **stable and noise-resistant switching** between high and low states.

## üîπ How It Works

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ When the Input Voltage is Below the Lower Threshold (V ü·¥õ):**
- The non-inverting input (**V‚Å∫**) of the op-amp is lower than the inverting input (**V‚Åª**).
- The op-amp output saturates to **HIGH** (close to +Vcc).
- The positive feedback through resistors **R1** and **R2** raises the reference voltage.
- The circuit remains in the HIGH state until the input voltage reaches the upper threshold.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ When the Input Voltage Exceeds the Upper Threshold (V·¥ú·¥õ):**
- The non-inverting input (**V‚Å∫**) becomes greater than the inverting input (**V‚Åª**).
- The op-amp output saturates to **LOW** (close to -Vcc or 0V).
- The feedback shifts the reference voltage lower, ensuring that small input fluctuations don‚Äôt cause rapid switching.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ When the Input Voltage Falls Below the Lower Threshold (V ü·¥õ):**
- The non-inverting input (**V‚Å∫**) is again lower than the reference voltage.
- The op-amp output switches back to **HIGH**.
- The feedback raises the reference voltage, maintaining stability until the next threshold crossing.

## **üîπ Role of Positive Feedback**
- Unlike a regular comparator, a Schmitt Trigger **adds positive feedback** via resistors to create hysteresis.
- This feedback changes the reference voltage dynamically, preventing noise from causing unstable output transitions.
- The gap between **V·¥ú·¥õ** and **V ü·¥õ** is what makes the Schmitt Trigger immune to small fluctuations.

---

## **üîπ Formula for Threshold Voltages**
If the circuit uses a **resistor divider (R1, R2)** for feedback, the threshold voltages are:  
- **Upper Threshold (V·¥ú·¥õ) = (R2 / (R1 + R2)) * V·¥è·¥ú·¥õ(high)**  
- **Lower Threshold (V ü·¥õ) = (R2 / (R1 + R2)) * V·¥è·¥ú·¥õ(low)**  

By selecting **R1 and R2**, you can adjust the hysteresis range.

# ‚ö° Schmitt Trigger Using Transisor

A **Transistor-Based Schmitt Trigger** is an essential circuit in electronics that converts noisy or slow analog signals into a clean digital output by using **hysteresis**. It is based on **bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)** and provides enhanced noise immunity and stability. The Schmitt Trigger is a type of **comparator** but with hysteresis, making it useful in noisy environments or systems where a sharp transition from low to high is required.

## üîπ How It Works

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ When the Input Voltage is Below the Lower Threshold**
- The **transistor (Q1)** is **OFF** because the input voltage is too low to forward-bias the base-emitter junction.
- The **output voltage** remains **HIGH** because the pull-up resistor **R1** keeps the output at the positive supply voltage.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ When the Input Voltage Exceeds the Upper Threshold**
- The **transistor (Q1)** turns **ON**, causing the output to quickly drop from **HIGH** to **LOW**.
- The **feedback resistor (R2)** creates positive feedback, ensuring the output stays **LOW** even if the input voltage momentarily falls below the lower threshold.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ When the Input Voltage Falls Below the Lower Threshold**
- The **transistor (Q1)** turns **OFF** again, and the output **returns to HIGH**, maintaining stability until the input voltage exceeds the upper threshold again.

This feedback mechanism creates two different threshold voltages: one for rising edges (upper threshold) and one for falling edges (lower threshold), providing **hysteresis**.
