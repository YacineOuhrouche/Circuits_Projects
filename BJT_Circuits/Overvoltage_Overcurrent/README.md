## ðŸ“Œ Overvoltage Protection Circuits
Overvoltage protection circuits prevent excessive voltage from reaching sensitive components by **clamping, shunting, or disconnecting** the voltage source.

### ðŸ”¹ **Zener Diode Overvoltage Protection**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **Zener diode** is placed in parallel with the load.
- When voltage exceeds the **breakdown voltage**, the Zener diode conducts and **shunts excess voltage** to ground.
- A **series resistor** limits the current to prevent damage.

ðŸ›  **Simulation Result:**  

âœ… **Applications:**
- Power supply regulation
- Microcontroller input protection
- Battery-operated devices

### ðŸ”¹ **TVS (Transient Voltage Suppression) Diode Protection**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **TVS diode** acts like a fast-response Zener diode, clamping transient voltage spikes.
- When a voltage surge occurs, the TVS diode **absorbs** the excess energy and protects sensitive components.

âœ… **Applications:**
- Surge protection for power lines
- ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection in ICs
- Automotive electronics

## ðŸ“Œ Overcurrent Protection Circuits
Overcurrent protection circuits **detect excessive current flow** and either **limit, break, or reroute** the current to prevent overheating or damage.

### ðŸ”¹ **Fuse-Based Overcurrent Protection**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **fuse** is placed in series with the circuit.
- If the current exceeds a certain limit, the fuse **blows**, disconnecting the circuit and preventing damage.
- Once blown, the fuse **must be replaced**.

ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**  

âœ… **Applications:**
- Electrical appliances
- Automotive circuits
- Power supply protection

### ðŸ”¹ **PTC Resettable Fuse Protection**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) resistor** increases resistance when current exceeds a set threshold.
- This limits the current flow without permanently disconnecting the circuit.
- Once the fault is removed, the PTC fuse **automatically resets**.

ðŸ›  **Simulation Result:**  

âœ… **Applications:**
- USB port protection
- Battery packs
- LED drivers

### ðŸ”¹ **Current Limiting Circuit Using MOSFET**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **MOSFET** in series with the load limits the current flow by adjusting its resistance.
- A **sense resistor (Rs)** detects overcurrent, triggering a **control circuit** to reduce the MOSFET's conduction.

ðŸ›  **Simulation Result:**  

âœ… **Applications:**
- Power supplies
- Battery chargers
- Motor controllers

## ðŸ“Œ Efficiency Considerations
To maximize efficiency, these protection circuits should:
âœ… Have minimal power loss under normal conditions  
âœ… Respond **quickly** to faults  
âœ… Avoid **false triggering**  
âœ… Be **compact and cost-effective**
