# 🔄 BJT Current Mirror

Welcome to the **BJT Current Mirror** project repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates the design and working of a **Current Mirror** using Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs).  

## 📌 Overview  
A **Current Mirror** is an analog circuit that copies (mirrors) a reference current to another branch of the circuit. It is widely used in **biasing, current sources, and differential amplifiers**.

## ⚡ **How It Works**  
A BJT current mirror consists of **two identical transistors (Q1 & Q2)**. The first transistor (**Q1**) is configured to set the reference current, while the second transistor (**Q2**) mirrors this current to the output.  

### ✨ **Key Working Principles:**  
1. **Q1 and Q2 are matched transistors** (same type, characteristics).  
2. **Base-Emitter voltage (V_BE) is equal** for both transistors.  
3. **Collector current (I_C) of Q2 follows I_C of Q1**, creating a mirrored current.
