## ðŸ”¹ Types of Small-Signal Amplifiers
Small-signal amplifiers can be classified based on their transistor configurations:

1. **Common-Emitter (CE) Amplifier** â€“ High voltage & current gain
2. **Common-Collector (CC) (Emitter Follower)** â€“ Buffer, impedance matching
3. **Common-Base (CB) Amplifier** â€“ High-frequency applications

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Common-Emitter (CE) Amplifier
### ðŸ”¹ How It Works
- The **CE amplifier** provides high voltage gain and is widely used in signal amplification.
- The input is applied to the **base**, and the output is taken from the **collector**.
- The signal is **inverted** at the output.
