# 🔄 Cycloconverter  

## Overview  

A **Cycloconverter** is an AC-to-AC power converter that directly converts **input AC at one frequency to output AC at a lower frequency** without using an intermediate DC link. It is widely used in **high-power applications** such as industrial motor drives and railway traction systems.

## ⚡ How It Works  

A cycloconverter operates by **controlling the conduction of thyristors (SCRs)** in a specific pattern to generate a lower frequency AC output. It achieves this by:  

1. **Phase-Controlled Switching:** The input AC waveform is divided into sections, and specific parts of the waveform are selected to construct the output at a desired frequency.  
2. **Bidirectional Switching:** The circuit consists of two groups of thyristors – one for positive cycles and another for negative cycles.  
3. **Output Frequency Reduction:** The output frequency (fo) is always a **fraction** of the input frequency (fi), typically expressed as:  

   \[
   f_o = \frac{f_i}{n}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...
   \]

   where \( n \) is an integer.
