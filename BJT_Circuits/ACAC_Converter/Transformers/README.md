# 🔄 Transformers  

## Overview  

A **Transformer** is a static electrical device used to **step-up** or **step-down** the voltage of alternating current (AC) while maintaining the frequency. It works on the principle of **electromagnetic induction** and is widely used in electrical power systems to adjust voltage levels for power transmission and distribution.

## ⚡ How It Works  

A transformer operates by **inducing an electromotive force (EMF)** in the secondary coil through a changing magnetic field created by the alternating current in the primary coil. The voltage is transferred from the primary winding to the secondary winding according to the **turns ratio** of the coils.

1. **Magnetic Field Generation:** An alternating current in the primary coil generates a varying magnetic field that passes through the core and induces voltage in the secondary coil.
2. **Voltage Transformation:** The induced voltage in the secondary coil is determined by the turns ratio:
   

   V_p/V_S = N_p/N_s

   By adjusting the turns ratio, the transformer can **step-up** (increase voltage) or **step-down** (decrease voltage) the input AC voltage.
