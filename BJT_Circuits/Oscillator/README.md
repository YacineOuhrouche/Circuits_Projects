# ⏳ Oscillator Circuits

## 📢 Introduction

Oscillators are fundamental circuits in electronics that generate periodic waveforms without an external input. They are widely used in signal generation, clock circuits, RF communication, and waveform shaping.

This repository provides detailed explanations, schematics, and simulation results for various types of oscillators, including:

- ✔ RC Oscillators (Phase Shift, Wien Bridge)
- ✔ LC Oscillators (Colpitts, Hartley, Clapp)
- ✔ Crystal Oscillators
- ✔ Relaxation Oscillators (Astable Multivibrator, Schmitt Trigger)

## 🔄 Types of Oscillators

### 1️⃣ RC Oscillators (Low-Frequency Applications)

RC oscillators use resistors and capacitors to determine the oscillation frequency. They are ideal for audio and low-frequency signal generation.

#### ✅ Phase-Shift Oscillator
- Uses three RC networks to produce 180° phase shift.
- Requires positive feedback for sustained oscillations.
- Operates in the audio frequency range.
- To calculate the frequency you want to generate, use this formula:
  
  f = 1/(2PiRCsqrt(2n))

#### ✅ Wien Bridge Oscillator
- Uses a bridge circuit with a positive feedback loop.
- Provides low distortion sine waves.
- Used in audio signal generation.
- To calculate the frequency you want to generate, use this formula:
  
  \[
  f = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
  \]

### 2️⃣ LC Oscillators (High-Frequency Applications)

LC oscillators use inductors (L) and capacitors (C) to create a resonant circuit. They are common in RF circuits, transmitters, and high-frequency applications.

#### ✅ Colpitts Oscillator
- Uses a capacitor voltage divider.
- High stability and frequency control.
- Used in RF and communication systems.
- The oscillation frequency is determined by:
  
  \[
  f = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}
  \]
