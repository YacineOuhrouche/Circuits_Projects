# 📌 Peak Detector Circuit

## 🔹 Overview  
A **Peak Detector Circuit** is used to capture and hold the **highest voltage level** of an input signal. It is commonly found in:  
✅ **Signal Processing**  
✅ **Communication Systems**  
✅ **Power Monitoring Circuits**  
✅ **Audio Envelope Detectors**  

It operates using a **diode, a capacitor, and an operational amplifier (op-amp)** to store and maintain the peak value of a varying signal.

## ⚙️ How the Peak Detector Works  
The circuit functions in two main modes:  

🔹 **1. Charging Mode:**  
- When the **input voltage increases**, the **diode conducts**, allowing the **capacitor to charge** up to the peak voltage.  
- The capacitor **stores the maximum voltage value** reached by the input signal.  

🔹 **2. Holding Mode:**  
- When the **input voltage drops**, the **diode prevents the capacitor from discharging**.  
- The capacitor **holds the peak value** until leakage or an external reset occurs.  
- An **op-amp buffer** may be used to prevent unwanted discharge and maintain a stable output.
