# âš¡ Bridge Rectifier with Capacitor Filter

Welcome to the **Bridge Rectifier** project! ðŸš€  
This project demonstrates how to build a **Bridge Rectifier** with a **Capacitor Filter** to convert **AC voltage** into **DC voltage** with reduced ripple. This is one of the most common rectifier designs used in power supplies.

## ðŸ“‘ What is a Bridge Rectifier?

A **Bridge Rectifier** uses **4 diodes** arranged in a bridge configuration to efficiently convert both halves of an AC waveform into **DC voltage**. Adding a capacitor filter helps **smooth out the pulsating DC**, reducing ripple and making the output closer to pure DC.

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works

1. **AC Input:**  
   AC voltage is applied to the input of the bridge rectifier.

2. **Diode Bridge Action:**  
   Each half-cycle of the AC waveform causes current to flow through different pairs of diodes, ensuring **the output polarity is always the same** (DC).

3. **Capacitor Filtering:**  
   The capacitor charges to the peak voltage and discharges slowly during dips, reducing the ripple between peaks, producing **a smoother DC output**.

4. **DC Output:**  
   The output is now ready for powering **DC circuits**.
