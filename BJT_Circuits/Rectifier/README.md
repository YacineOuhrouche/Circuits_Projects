## 📐 Rectifier Overviews

### 🔹 Half-Wave Rectifier

**What It Does:**  
- Allows only **one half-cycle** (positive or negative) of AC to pass, blocking the other half.
- Simple but inefficient.

### 🔹 Bridge Rectifier

**What It Does:**  
- Uses **4 diodes** in a bridge configuration to rectify both AC halves.
- No center-tap needed — simple and practical.
