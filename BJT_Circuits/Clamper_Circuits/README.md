# ðŸ“˜ Clamper Circuits â€“ A Comprehensive Guide

## âœ¨ Introduction
Clamper circuits, also known as **DC level shifters**, are electronic circuits that **add** or **subtract** a DC voltage to an AC signal without changing its shape. They are commonly used in TV receivers, oscilloscopes, and signal processing applications.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Clamper Circuits
Clamper circuits can be categorized into different types based on the polarity of the clamping voltage:

1. **Positive Clamper**
2. **Negative Clamper**
3. **Biased Clamper** (With a DC bias voltage)
4. **Combination Clampers**

## ðŸ“Œ Positive Clamper Circuit
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- The **diode** is placed in **parallel** with the output and conducts during the **negative half-cycle**.
- During this time, the **capacitor** charges to the peak value of the AC signal.
- During the **positive half-cycle**, the capacitor shifts the waveform **upward**, ensuring that the entire waveform moves **above** the zero reference level.



## ðŸ“Œ Negative Clamper Circuit
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**


ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- The **diode is reversed**, so it **conducts during the positive half-cycle**.
- The **capacitor charges** to the peak voltage and shifts the entire waveform **downward**, keeping the waveform below the zero reference.

## ðŸ“Œ Biased Clamper Circuit
ðŸ“· **Schematic Diagram:**



ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**
- A **DC bias voltage** is added in series with the **diode**.
- This allows us to shift the waveform to a **specific DC level**.
- Used in **TV receivers** and **oscilloscopes** to adjust signal positioning.
