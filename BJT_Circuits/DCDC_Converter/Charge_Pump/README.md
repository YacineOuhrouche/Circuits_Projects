# ⚡ Charge Pump Converters (Switched Capacitor)

A **Charge Pump** is a type of **DC-DC converter** that **changes the voltage level** by using capacitors and switches instead of inductors. Charge pumps are commonly used for **low-power applications** where a small increase or decrease in voltage is needed.

## 🔹 Types of Charge Pumps  

### **1️⃣ Voltage Doubler Charge Pump**
- **How It Works**: 
  - In this configuration, two capacitors and two diodes are used. The first capacitor is charged during one phase of the switch, and the second capacitor is charged and then connected to the output, effectively doubling the voltage.

### **2️⃣ Voltage Inverter Charge Pump**

- **How It Works**: 
  - This charge pump circuit inverts the polarity of the input voltage. It uses capacitors to store and transfer energy while utilizing diodes and switches to reverse the voltage.

## 🔹 Efficiency Considerations

The efficiency of charge pumps depends on factors such as:
- **Switching frequency**: Higher frequencies often improve efficiency but can lead to increased switching losses.
- **Capacitor quality**: Low ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) capacitors help reduce losses.
- **Load conditions**: Efficiency tends to decrease as the load current increases.

## 📌 Applications
- **Low-Power Electronics** – Charge pumps are ideal for small, portable devices where space and power efficiency are important.
- **Battery-Powered Devices** – Charge pumps help manage voltage levels in devices where battery power is used.
- **Audio Systems** – Used in circuits requiring negative voltage, like **audio amplifiers**.
- **LED Drivers** – Provides the necessary voltage levels for **LED lighting systems**.
