# ⚡ Isolated DC-DC Converters


## 🌟 Introduction

**Isolated DC-DC converters** are crucial in systems requiring **galvanic isolation**. Unlike non-isolated converters, which share a common ground between input and output, **isolated converters** provide **complete separation**, protecting the circuit from high-voltage surges, **electromagnetic interference (EMI)**, and **ground loops**. These converters are widely used in applications where **safety**, **reliability**, and **noise immunity** are essential.

## 🔌 How Isolated Converters Work

Isolated DC-DC converters typically utilize **transformers** to create electrical isolation. Here's a simple breakdown of how they work:

1. **Input Stage**: The DC voltage is converted to AC using a switching device (like a MOSFET).
2. **Transformation**: The AC signal is passed through a **transformer**, which adjusts the voltage while isolating the input and output.
3. **Rectification & Filtering**: The AC signal is rectified back to DC and filtered to smooth out voltage fluctuations.
4. **Output Stage**: The regulated DC output is provided to the load, ensuring stable power delivery.

## ⚡ Types of Isolated DC-DC Converters

Here are the most common types of isolated converters:

### 🔹 **Flyback Converter**
A **Flyback Converter** is commonly used for low to medium power applications. It stores energy in the transformer during the on-time of the switch and releases it during the off-time.

**Applications**:  
- Power supplies for **TVs**  
- **Chargers**  
- Small appliances
