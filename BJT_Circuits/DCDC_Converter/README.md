# ⚡ DC-DC Converters

## 📘 Introduction
DC-DC converters are electronic circuits that convert one DC voltage level to another. They are widely used in power supplies, battery management systems, and embedded electronics where efficient voltage regulation is required.

These converters operate by **storing energy in inductors or capacitors and switching it rapidly** to step up, step down, or invert voltage levels efficiently.

## 🔹 Types of DC-DC Converters
DC-DC converters can be classified into different categories based on their operation:

1. **Buck Converter (Step-Down)** – Converts a higher DC voltage to a lower one.
2. **Boost Converter (Step-Up)** – Increases a lower DC voltage to a higher one.
3. **Buck-Boost Converter (Inverting or Non-Inverting)** – Can either step up or step down the voltage.
4. **SEPIC (Single-Ended Primary Inductor Converter)** – Provides a regulated output voltage that can be higher or lower than the input.
5. **Cuk Converter** – Provides an inverted output voltage.
6. **Flyback Converter** – Uses a transformer to step up/down and isolate the output.
7. **Forward Converter** – Similar to a flyback but with continuous energy transfer.

## 1️⃣ Buck Converter (Step-Down)

### 📌 Circuit Description
- **Input Voltage:** Higher DC voltage.
- **Output Voltage:** Lower DC voltage.
- **Components:** Inductor, diode, capacitor, and a switching MOSFET.
- **Operation:** The transistor switches ON/OFF rapidly, allowing controlled energy transfer to the inductor.

### ⚡ How It Works
- When the switch (MOSFET) is **ON**, current flows through the inductor, storing energy.
- When the switch is **OFF**, the inductor releases stored energy, maintaining a continuous output voltage.
- A **capacitor** smooths the output voltage, reducing ripple.

## 2️⃣ Boost Converter (Step-Up)

### 📌 Circuit Description
- **Input Voltage:** Lower DC voltage.
- **Output Voltage:** Higher DC voltage.
- **Components:** Inductor, diode, capacitor, and a switching MOSFET.
- **Operation:** Uses inductor energy storage to increase voltage.

### ⚡ How It Works
- When the switch is **ON**, current flows through the inductor, storing energy.
- When the switch turns **OFF**, the inductor releases energy, boosting the voltage higher than the input.
- The **diode** prevents backflow, and the **capacitor** smooths the output.
