# ⚡ DC-DC Converters

## 📘 Introduction
DC-DC converters are electronic circuits that convert one DC voltage level to another. They are widely used in power supplies, battery management systems, and embedded electronics where efficient voltage regulation is required.

These converters operate by **storing energy in inductors or capacitors and switching it rapidly** to step up, step down, or invert voltage levels efficiently.

---

## 🔹 Types of DC-DC Converters
DC-DC converters can be classified into different categories based on their operation:

1. **Buck Converter (Step-Down)** – Converts a higher DC voltage to a lower one.
2. **Boost Converter (Step-Up)** – Increases a lower DC voltage to a higher one.
3. **Buck-Boost Converter (Inverting or Non-Inverting)** – Can either step up or step down the voltage.
4. **SEPIC (Single-Ended Primary Inductor Converter)** – Provides a regulated output voltage that can be higher or lower than the input.
5. **Cuk Converter** – Provides an inverted output voltage.
6. **Flyback Converter** – Uses a transformer to step up/down and isolate the output.
7. **Forward Converter** – Similar to a flyback but with continuous energy transfer.

# ⚡ Buck Converter (Step-Down)  

A **Buck Converter** is a DC-DC power converter that **steps down a higher input voltage** to a **lower output voltage** efficiently. It is widely used in power supplies, voltage regulators, and battery management systems.  

---

## 🔹 How It Works  

### **1️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is ON**  
- The **MOSFET (switch) is closed**, allowing current to flow from the **input voltage (V_in)** through the **inductor (L)** to the **load (R_load)**.  
- The **inductor stores energy** in its **magnetic field** as current increases.  
- The **diode (D) is reverse-biased** (OFF) and does not conduct.  
- The **capacitor (C) helps maintain a stable output voltage** by storing charge.  

### **2️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is OFF**  
- The **MOSFET turns OFF**, stopping the direct current flow from **V_in**.  
- The **inductor resists sudden changes in current** and tries to maintain the flow.  
- To do so, the inductor’s **stored energy is released**, continuing to supply current to the load.  
- The **diode becomes forward-biased**, providing a path for current.  
- The **capacitor smooths the output voltage**, reducing ripple.  

---

### **Why the output voltage is lower?**
-The buck converter reduces the voltage because it only allows a portion of the input voltage to pass to the output based on the duty cycle (D) of the switching signal. The duty cycle is the ratio of the time the switch is ON to the total switching period:
- V_out = D X V_In

# ⚡ Boost Converter (Step-Up)  

A **Boost Converter** is a DC-DC power converter that steps up a **lower input voltage** to a **higher output voltage** efficiently. It is widely used in battery-powered systems, renewable energy applications, and power electronics.  

---

## 🔹 How It Works  

### **1️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is ON**  
- The **MOSFET (switch) is closed**, allowing current to flow from the **input voltage (V_in)** through the **inductor (L)** to ground.  
- The **inductor stores energy** in its **magnetic field** as current increases.  
- The **diode (D) is reverse-biased** (OFF) and does not conduct.  
- The **capacitor (C) supplies current** to the load to maintain a stable output voltage.  

### **2️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is OFF**  
- The **MOSFET turns OFF**, stopping the direct current flow from **V_in** to ground.  
- The **inductor resists sudden changes in current** and tries to maintain the flow.  
- The **inductor’s stored energy is released**, adding to **V_in**, boosting the voltage.  
- The **diode becomes forward-biased**, allowing energy to reach the output.  
- The **capacitor smooths the output voltage**, reducing ripple.  

### Why the output voltage is higher?
-The boost converter increases the voltage by adding the inductor’s energy to the input voltage. The relationship between the output and input voltage is determined by the duty cycle (D):
- V_out =  V_In/(1-D)

---
### Why the Output Voltage Can Be Higher or Lower
-The buck-boost converter is unique because it inverts the polarity of the output voltage, meaning the output is negative with respect to the input. The voltage conversion ratio is given by:
- V_out =  -V_In/(1-D)
- If D > 0.5 (boost mode)
- If D < 0.5 (Buck mode)
