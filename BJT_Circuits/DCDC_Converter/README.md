# ⚡ DC-DC Converters

## 📘 Introduction
DC-DC converters are electronic circuits that convert one DC voltage level to another. They are widely used in power supplies, battery management systems, and embedded electronics where efficient voltage regulation is required.

These converters operate by **storing energy in inductors or capacitors and switching it rapidly** to step up, step down, or invert voltage levels efficiently.

## 🔹 Types of DC-DC Converters
DC-DC converters can be classified into different categories based on their operation:

1. **Buck Converter (Step-Down)** – Converts a higher DC voltage to a lower one.
2. **Boost Converter (Step-Up)** – Increases a lower DC voltage to a higher one.
3. **Buck-Boost Converter (Inverting or Non-Inverting)** – Can either step up or step down the voltage.
4. **SEPIC (Single-Ended Primary Inductor Converter)** – Provides a regulated output voltage that can be higher or lower than the input.
5. **Cuk Converter** – Provides an inverted output voltage.
6. **Flyback Converter** – Uses a transformer to step up/down and isolate the output.
7. **Forward Converter** – Similar to a flyback but with continuous energy transfer.

# ⚡ Buck Converter (Step-Down)  

A **Buck Converter** is a DC-DC power converter that **steps down a higher input voltage** to a **lower output voltage** efficiently. It is widely used in power supplies, voltage regulators, and battery management systems.

## 🔹 How It Works  

### **1️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is ON**  
- The **MOSFET (switch) is closed**, allowing current to flow from the **input voltage (V_in)** through the **inductor (L)** to the **load (R_load)**.  
- The **inductor stores energy** in its **magnetic field** as current increases.  
- The **diode (D) is reverse-biased** (OFF) and does not conduct.  
- The **capacitor (C) helps maintain a stable output voltage** by storing charge.  

### **2️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is OFF**  
- The **MOSFET turns OFF**, stopping the direct current flow from **V_in**.  
- The **inductor resists sudden changes in current** and tries to maintain the flow.  
- To do so, the inductor’s **stored energy is released**, continuing to supply current to the load.  
- The **diode becomes forward-biased**, providing a path for current.  
- The **capacitor smooths the output voltage**, reducing ripple.
