# ‚ö° Buck Converter (Step-Down)  

A **Buck Converter** is a DC-DC power converter that **steps down a higher input voltage** to a **lower output voltage** efficiently. It is widely used in power supplies, voltage regulators, and battery management systems.

## üîπ How It Works  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ When the MOSFET Switch is ON**  
- The **MOSFET (switch) is closed**, allowing current to flow from the **input voltage (V_in)** through the **inductor (L)** to the **load (R_load)**.  
- The **inductor stores energy** in its **magnetic field** as current increases.  
- The **diode (D) is reverse-biased** (OFF) and does not conduct.  
- The **capacitor (C) helps maintain a stable output voltage** by storing charge.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ When the MOSFET Switch is OFF**  
- The **MOSFET turns OFF**, stopping the direct current flow from **V_in**.  
- The **inductor resists sudden changes in current** and tries to maintain the flow.  
- To do so, the inductor‚Äôs **stored energy is released**, continuing to supply current to the load.  
- The **diode becomes forward-biased**, providing a path for current.  
- The **capacitor smooths the output voltage**, reducing ripple.

### **Why the output voltage is lower?**
- The buck converter reduces the voltage because it only allows a portion of the input voltage to pass to the output based on the duty cycle (D) of the switching signal. The duty cycle is the ratio of the time the switch is ON to the total switching period:
  
  \[ V_{out} = D \times V_{in} \]

### **Average Efficiency:**
- The average efficiency of a buck converter typically ranges between **85% and 90%** under typical operating conditions. This means that around 10% to 15% of the input power is lost as heat due to factors such as switching losses, conduction losses, and component inefficiencies.

### **Factors Contributing to Losses:**
- **Switching and Conduction Losses** are the primary contributors to the losses, typically accounting for about **50% to 60%** of the total loss.
- **Inductor and Capacitor Losses** contribute around **30% to 40%** of the total loss.
- **Diode Losses** contribute the remaining **10% to 15%** of the total loss, especially in non-synchronous buck converters.
