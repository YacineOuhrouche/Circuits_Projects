# ⚡ Ćuk Converter (Step-Up/Step-Down DC-DC)  

A **Ćuk Converter** is a **DC-DC power converter** that provides a **negative output voltage** while efficiently stepping up or stepping down the input voltage. It is widely used in **power supplies, renewable energy systems, and motor drives** where voltage inversion and regulation are needed.

## 🔹 How It Works  

### **1️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is ON**  
- The **MOSFET (switch) is closed**, allowing current to flow through the **input inductor (L1)** and store energy in its **magnetic field**.  
- The **coupling capacitor (C1) charges**, transferring energy between the input and output stages.  
- The **diode (D) is reverse-biased** (OFF), preventing current flow to the output.  
- The **output inductor (L2) supplies current to the load**, maintaining continuous operation.  
- The **output capacitor (C_out) smooths the voltage**, ensuring minimal ripple.  

### **2️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is OFF**  
- The **MOSFET turns OFF**, stopping direct current flow from **V_in**.  
- The **magnetic field of L1 collapses**, transferring stored energy through **C1 to L2**.  
- The **diode (D) becomes forward-biased**, allowing current to flow to the output.  
- The **output inductor (L2) releases its stored energy**, continuing to supply current to the load.  
- The **capacitor C_out stabilizes the output voltage**, reducing fluctuations.

### Why the Output Voltage Can Be Higher or Lower
- The calculation is the same as for the **Buck-Boost Converter**.
