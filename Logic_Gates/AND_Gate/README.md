# AND Gate Using Transistors

## 📝 What It Does

The **AND gate** outputs `HIGH` (1) **only if both inputs are HIGH** (1).  
If either input is LOW (0), the output is LOW (0).

## 📊 Truth Table

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|--|--|--|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

## ⚙️ How It Works with Transistors

This AND gate uses **two NPN transistors** in **series**:

- Input A controls Transistor 1.
- Input B controls Transistor 2.
- Both transistors must be ON (HIGH inputs) for current to flow to the output.
- If either transistor is OFF, the current path breaks and the output is LOW.

## 📐 Schematic

This is the transistor-level schematic for the AND gate:
(I forgot to put two switch to the left of the two transistor)
