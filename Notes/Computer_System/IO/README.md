# 🖧 Input/Output (I/O) and Interrupts

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Input/Output (I/O)** refers to the mechanisms by which a computer system communicates with the external environment—such as keyboards, displays, storage, and networks. **Interrupts** are signals that temporarily halt CPU operations, allowing the system to respond to time-critical events. This section explores the fundamentals of I/O handling, I/O types, interrupt-driven I/O, polling, context switching, and Direct Memory Access (DMA).

## 🎯 Purpose of I/O & Interrupt Systems

- **Enable External Communication**: Facilitates interaction between the CPU and peripherals.
- **Efficient Event Handling**: Interrupts allow prompt response to external events.
- **Optimizes CPU Utilization**: Reduces idle waiting time via interrupt-driven techniques.
- **Supports Real-Time Applications**: Crucial for time-sensitive operations like device control.

## 🧩 Key Concepts in I/O and Interrupts

### 1️⃣ **I/O Techniques**

#### **Programmed I/O (Polling)**

> The CPU actively checks device status and initiates data transfers.

- 🔄 Continuous polling loop.
- ❌ Wastes CPU cycles when waiting.
- ✅ Simple to implement.

**👉 [More on Polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input%E2%80%93output)**

#### **Interrupt-Driven I/O**

> Devices notify the CPU when they are ready, allowing asynchronous operations.

- 🔔 CPU is interrupted only when needed.
- ✅ More efficient CPU usage.
- ✅ Better for multitasking systems.

#### **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**

> A DMA controller transfers data directly between memory and I/O devices without CPU intervention.

- ⚡ High-speed transfers.
- ✅ Offloads CPU from I/O tasks.
- 🚦 Useful in high-bandwidth I/O (e.g., disk, network).

| I/O Method         | CPU Involvement           | Efficiency   | Use Case Example         |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Polling**        | Constantly checking       | Low          | Reading keyboard input    |
| **Interrupt**      | Reacts to signals         | High         | Network packet arrival    |
| **DMA**            | Minimal, controller-driven| Very High    | Disk-to-memory transfer   |

### 2️⃣ **Interrupts**

> Interrupts are signals that divert the CPU from its current task to handle an external or internal event.

#### **Types of Interrupts**

- ⚙️ **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by external devices (e.g., keyboard, timer).
- 💻 **Software Interrupts**: Triggered by programs (e.g., system calls, exceptions).

#### **Interrupt Handling Sequence**

1. Save CPU state (context).
2. Identify the interrupt source.
3. Execute the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
4. Restore CPU state and resume execution.

| Interrupt Type      | Source                  | Example                           |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Hardware**         | External device signal   | Keyboard key press, timer signal |
| **Software**         | System call or trap      | Division by zero, syscall         |

### 3️⃣ **Polling vs Interrupts**

| Feature            | Polling                         | Interrupts                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **CPU Usage**      | Actively waits                  | Only works when needed             |
| **Efficiency**     | Inefficient                     | Highly efficient                   |
| **Complexity**     | Simple to implement             | Requires ISR setup and handling    |
| **Latency**        | High                            | Low (faster response)              |

### 4️⃣ **Context Switching**

> Context switching occurs when the CPU switches from one process or interrupt handler to another, saving and restoring states.

- 🔁 Saves registers, stack pointer, program counter.
- 💾 Restores state of the next process or ISR.
- 🔧 Essential for multitasking and interrupt handling.

| Component Saved      | Purpose                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Program Counter**  | Resume execution at the right place |
| **Registers**        | Retain computation state         |
| **Stack Pointer**    | Maintain call stack integrity     |
