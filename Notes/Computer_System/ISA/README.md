# 🧠 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

---

## ✨ Introduction

The **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** defines the interface between hardware and software. It specifies the supported instructions, formats, registers, data types, and memory access mechanisms that a processor can execute. Understanding ISA is crucial for low-level programming, compiler design, and system architecture.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of ISA

- **Defines CPU Instruction Set**: Describes what operations a processor can perform.
- **Bridges Hardware and Software**: Acts as a contract between machine code and CPU design.
- **Supports Program Execution**: Determines how programs access memory and perform computations.

## 🧩 Key Components of ISA

### 1️⃣ **Instruction Formats**

> Instructions are binary-encoded operations. Their format determines how operations, operands, and memory addresses are structured in machine code.

- 🔠 **Opcode**: Specifies the operation to perform (e.g., `ADD`, `LOAD`).
- 🧮 **Operands**: Registers, constants, or memory locations involved in the operation.
- 📍 **Addressing Info**: Indicates how to access memory or data.

| Format Type | Description                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **R-Type**  | Register-to-register operations        |
| **I-Type**  | Uses immediate (constant) values       |
| **J-Type**  | Jump instructions for control flow     |

---

### 2️⃣ **Instruction Types**

| ⚙️ Type             | 🔍 Description                                | 🧪 Example         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Data Transfer**    | Moves data between registers and memory       | `LOAD`, `STORE`    |
| **Arithmetic**       | Performs math operations                      | `ADD`, `SUB`       |
| **Logical**          | Executes bitwise operations                   | `AND`, `OR`        |
| **Control Flow**     | Alters program execution path                 | `JMP`, `CALL`      |
| **Comparison**       | Compares values and sets condition flags      | `CMP`, `TEST`      |

---

### 3️⃣ **Addressing Modes**

> Addressing modes specify how the operands of an instruction are accessed or calculated.

| 🧰 Mode                | 📝 Description                                       | 📌 Example           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Immediate**           | Operand is directly in the instruction              | `MOV R1, #10`        |
| **Register**            | Operand is in a CPU register                        | `ADD R1, R2`         |
| **Direct**              | Operand is at a memory address                      | `LOAD R1, 0x2000`    |
| **Indirect**            | Address is in a register (pointer-like behavior)    | `LOAD R1, [R2]`      |
| **Indexed**             | Combines register with offset                       | `LOAD R1, [R2 + 4]`  |

### 4️⃣ **RISC vs. CISC**

| 🧠 Architecture | 🔎 Description                                                              | 📌 Examples         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **RISC**          | Reduced instruction set with simple, fast operations                     | ARM, MIPS, RISC-V   |
| **CISC**          | Complex instruction set with multi-step operations in fewer instructions | Intel x86, 8086     |

#### ✅ RISC Characteristics
- Fixed-length instructions
- Fewer addressing modes
- Simpler hardware, faster pipelining
- Compiler handles more workload

#### ✅ CISC Characteristics
- Variable-length instructions
- Complex operations in one instruction
- Optimized for memory usage
- Hardware handles complex logic
