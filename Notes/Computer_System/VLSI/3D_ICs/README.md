## ✨ Introduction

**3D ICs (Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits)** are an advanced technology that stacks multiple layers of **silicon wafers** to create highly integrated, high-performance chips. By vertically stacking these layers, 3D ICs enable **better performance**, **reduced power consumption**, and **increased functionality** in a smaller footprint compared to traditional 2D ICs.

The main benefits of **3D ICs** include higher **interconnect density**, **shorter interconnects**, and the ability to integrate **heterogeneous components** (e.g., logic, memory, analog, and sensors) on the same chip.
