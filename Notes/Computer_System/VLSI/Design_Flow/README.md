## ü™ú Design Flow Stages

| **Stage**               | **Description**                                                                                   | **Output**                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **1. Specification**     | Define design requirements such as functionality, power, area, timing, and cost constraints.     | System specifications           |
| **2. RTL Design**        | Describe the circuit at the behavioral level using hardware description languages (HDLs).         | RTL Code (Verilog/VHDL)         |
| **3. Logic Synthesis**   | Convert RTL code into a gate-level netlist using synthesis tools.                                 | Gate-level netlist              |
| **4. Physical Design**   | Convert the netlist into a physical layout (floorplan, placement, routing, DRC/LVS).              | GDSII Layout                    |
| **5. Fabrication**       | Fabricate the chip on silicon using the layout masks in a foundry.                               | Silicon Die (Chip)              |
| **6. Testing**           | Perform functional and parametric tests to verify the chip‚Äôs correctness and yield.               | Test reports, binning           |
