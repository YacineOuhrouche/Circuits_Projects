## ✨ Introduction

**Digital VLSI Design** focuses on creating **digital logic circuits** integrated into **Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)** chips. These circuits process **discrete binary signals (0s and 1s)** using gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and memory cells.

Digital VLSI powers the core of modern electronics, from **microprocessors**, **FPGAs**, and **memory**, to **communication systems** and **embedded controllers**. It involves multiple abstraction levels—from behavioral modeling to physical layout.
