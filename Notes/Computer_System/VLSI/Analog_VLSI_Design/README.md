## ⚙️ Key Design Considerations

### 1️⃣ Power Consumption

> Analog blocks must be optimized for **low power**, especially in battery-operated and IoT devices.

- 🔋 **Biasing techniques** to ensure minimal static power.
- 🌡️ **Sub-threshold operation** for ultra-low power.
- ⚡ **Low-voltage design** with reliable headroom.

**📌 Used In**: Medical devices, wearables, low-power sensors.

### 3️⃣ CMOS vs Bipolar

> Technology choice impacts **gain**, **speed**, and **power**.

| Feature         | CMOS                             | Bipolar                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Power           | Very low                         | Moderate to high                 |
| Gain            | Moderate                         | High                             |
| Speed           | Good for low-mid freq            | Excellent for high-speed apps    |
| Integration     | High (mixed-signal friendly)     | Limited (mostly analog)          |

**📌 CMOS** is dominant in modern analog VLSI.
