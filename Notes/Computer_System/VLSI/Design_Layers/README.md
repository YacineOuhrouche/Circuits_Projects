# üìö VLSI Design Layers

This section breaks down the **abstraction layers** in VLSI design ‚Äî each playing a critical role from high-level system specification to physical chip fabrication. These layers help structure the design process, enabling efficient collaboration between system architects, logic designers, and physical design engineers.

## üß± Design Abstraction Layers Overview

| **Layer**             | **Description**                                                                                  | **Design Output**              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **1. System Level**   | Defines system functionality, behavior, and data flow at a very high abstraction.                | System architecture, block diagrams |
| **2. RTL Level**      | Describes how data flows between registers and operations are performed using HDLs (Verilog/VHDL).| RTL code (e.g., Verilog)       |
| **3. Gate Level**     | Represents logic in terms of logic gates and flip-flops generated through synthesis.             | Netlist                        |
| **4. Transistor Level**| Translates logic gates to CMOS transistor circuits. Used in custom or analog IC design.         | SPICE netlist / Transistor schematics |
| **5. Layout Level**   | Actual physical geometry of transistors, wires, and cells to be fabricated.                      | GDSII Layout Files             |
| **6. Fabrication Level**| Describes the final photomask layers used to manufacture the chip on silicon.                  | Mask set / Wafer design        |
