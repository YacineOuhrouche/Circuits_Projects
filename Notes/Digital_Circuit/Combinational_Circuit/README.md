# 🔌 Combinational Logic Circuits

Welcome to the **Combinational Logic Circuits** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **combinational logic circuits** using basic logic gates like **AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR**, and more. Combinational circuits are fundamental in digital electronics, as their output depends only on the current inputs, with no memory or feedback elements involved.

Combinational logic circuits are used in a variety of applications, including arithmetic operations, data processing, multiplexing, and encoding/decoding systems.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup

| **🔲 Adder/Substractor**                | Adds/subbs two binary numbers and a carry(borrow) input to produce a sum or substraction       | [View Folder](./+_-/)                        |
| **🔲 Multiplexer (MUX)**         | Selects one of many inputs and routes it to a single output                        | [View Folder](./MUX/)                       |
| **🔲 Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**     | Routes a single input to one of many outputs based on a selector                   | [View Folder](./DEMUX/)                     |
| **🔲 Decoder**                   | Converts binary input into a one-hot output for address decoding                   | [View Folder](./Decoder/)                           |
| **🔲 Encoder**                   | Converts multiple inputs into a binary code that represents the active input       | [View Folder](./Encoder/)                           |
| **🔲 Comparator**                | Compares two binary numbers and outputs the result of the comparison (equal, greater, or less) | [View Folder](./Comparator/)                        |
