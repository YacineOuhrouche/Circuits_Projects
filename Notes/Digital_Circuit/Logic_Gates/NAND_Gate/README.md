# NAND Gate Using Transistors

## 📝 What It Does

A **NAND gate** is the opposite (negation) of an **AND gate**. It gives a LOW (0) output only when **both inputs** are HIGH (1). For all other input combinations, it gives a HIGH (1) output.

## 📊 Truth Table

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

## ⚙️ How It Works with Transistors

The NAND gate is implemented using **two NPN transistors** in series:

- When **both inputs are HIGH**, both transistors conduct, pulling the output LOW.
- When **either or both inputs are LOW**, the transistors do not conduct, and the output stays HIGH.

This behavior is the inverse of the **AND gate** because of the negation (NOT) applied to the AND output.
