# 📡 Active Filters: An Introduction

Welcome to the **Active Filters** resource page! 🎉  
This page explains **what active filters are**, how they work, and provides links to explore each type of filter in detail.

## ⚙️ What Are Active Filters?

**Active Filters** are electronic circuits that allow certain frequency ranges to pass through while blocking others, and they require an **external power source**. Unlike passive filters that rely solely on resistors, capacitors, and inductors, active filters use **active components** like **op-amps (operational amplifiers)**, **BJTs**, or **FETs** to achieve better performance, such as **amplification**, **sharp cutoff** characteristics, and the ability to drive loads.

| Filter Type | Description | Link |
|--|--|--|
| 🎚️ Low Pass Filter (LPF) | Passes low frequencies, blocks high frequencies | [Low Pass Filter](./LPF/) |
| 🎚️ High Pass Filter (HPF) | Passes high frequencies, blocks low frequencies | [High Pass Filter](./HPF/) |
| 🎚️ Band Pass Filter (BPF) | Passes only a specific band of frequencies | [Band Pass Filter](./BPF/) |
| 🎚️ Band Stop Filter (BSF) | Blocks a specific band of frequencies | [Band Stop Filter](./BSF/) |
