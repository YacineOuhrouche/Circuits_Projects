# 🛠️ Advanced Signal Processing

## ✨ Introduction

**Advanced Signal Processing** techniques enable more efficient and powerful analysis of complex or non-stationary signals. These methods extend beyond classical Fourier analysis and are widely used in areas such as **biomedical signal processing**, **communications**, **radar**, and **machine learning**.

This section covers essential tools such as:

- ✅ Adaptive Filtering  
- 🌊 Wavelet Transforms  
- 🧠 Time-Frequency Analysis  
- 🔁 Nonlinear & Statistical Signal Processing

## 🔄 Adaptive Filtering

> Adaptive filters automatically adjust their parameters in real time based on the input signal and a desired output, using algorithms like **LMS** or **RLS**.

### 🔧 How It Works

- Filter coefficients are updated **iteratively** to minimize an **error signal** between the output and a reference.
- Common algorithms:  
  - **LMS (Least Mean Squares)**  
  - **RLS (Recursive Least Squares)**

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Echo cancellation (e.g., in telephony)
- Noise suppression (e.g., hearing aids)
- Channel equalization in communication systems

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Adapts in real-time environments   | LMS may converge slowly                   |
| Works with unknown or changing signals | RLS is computationally intensive        |

## 🌊 Wavelet Transform

> Unlike Fourier Transform, which only analyzes frequency, **Wavelet Transform** analyzes both **time and frequency**, offering multi-resolution analysis.

### 🔧 How It Works

- Signal is passed through **scaling and wavelet functions**.
- Outputs **approximation** (low-frequency) and **detail** (high-frequency) coefficients.
- Performed recursively using **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** or **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)**.


### 🧭 Typical Uses

- ECG signal denoising and compression
- Image and video compression (e.g., JPEG2000)
- Fault detection in power systems and gearboxes

| ✅ Pros                          | ❌ Cons                                    |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Time-frequency localization      | Choice of wavelet affects results          |
| Captures transients and edges   | May require more complex implementation    |

## 🧠 Time-Frequency Analysis (STFT & Others)

> Used for analyzing **non-stationary** signals where frequency content changes over time. Includes techniques like **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** and **Wigner-Ville distribution**.

### 🔧 How It Works

- **STFT**: Signal is divided into overlapping windows; Fourier Transform is applied to each.
- **Wigner-Ville**: Uses signal's autocorrelation function for high-resolution joint analysis.


### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Speech and audio analysis
- Radar and sonar pulse detection
- Vibration analysis in mechanical systems

| ✅ Pros                               | ❌ Cons                                     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Reveals frequency evolution over time | Time and frequency resolution are limited   |
| Useful for real-time monitoring       | STFT requires large memory for spectrograms |

## 📈 Nonlinear & Statistical Signal Processing

> Handles signals with **non-Gaussian**, **nonlinear**, or **chaotic** behavior. Includes tools like **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**, **Kalman Filters**, and **Higher-Order Statistics**.

### 🔧 How It Works

- **ICA**: Separates mixed signals into statistically independent sources.
- **Kalman Filter**: Predicts and corrects state of dynamic systems.
- **Higher-Order Moments**: Analyze skewness, kurtosis, etc., beyond power spectrum.


### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Biomedical signal separation (e.g., EEG, fMRI)
- Target tracking in radar
- Financial time-series forecasting

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Effective for complex systems       | Often requires detailed statistical models |
| Can separate overlapping sources    | Computationally expensive               |
