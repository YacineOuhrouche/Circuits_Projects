# 🔄 Transform Techniques

---

## ✨ Overview

Transform techniques are **powerful mathematical tools** used to analyze signals and systems in alternative domains (frequency, s-plane, z-plane). They simplify complex differential/difference equations into algebraic expressions, enabling easier analysis and design.

This section covers the most important transforms used in signal processing:
- **Fourier Series & Fourier Transform**
- **Laplace Transform**
- **Z-Transform**
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) & Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**

## 🌐 Why Use Transforms?

Transforms allow you to:
- Analyze signals in **frequency** rather than time
- Solve **differential/difference equations** efficiently
- Design and analyze **filters, systems, and circuits**
- Understand **spectral content** and behavior of signals
