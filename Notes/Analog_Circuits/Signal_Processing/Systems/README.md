# üîß Types of Systems

## ‚ú® Overview

In signal processing and control, **systems** transform input signals into outputs based on defined mathematical rules or physical processes. Understanding system types is fundamental to analyzing behavior, designing filters, and ensuring stability in real-world applications.

This section covers system classifications such as:
- **Continuous-Time vs Discrete-Time**
- **FIR vs IIR Filters**
- **System Properties** (Causality, Linearity, Stability, etc.)
- **System Classification Summary**

## üìä System Classifications

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous-Time vs Discrete-Time Systems

| Type             | Description                                     | Example Application           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Continuous-Time  | Operates on signals defined for all `t`         | Analog circuits, RLC systems  |
| Discrete-Time    | Operates on signals defined at intervals `n`    | Digital signal processors (DSP)|

> ‚è±Ô∏è Discrete-time systems are typically implemented using digital computers or microcontrollers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ FIR vs IIR Filters

| Type     | Description                                | Impulse Response     | Stability      | Recursiveness |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| FIR      | Depends only on current & past inputs       | Finite duration      | Always stable  | Non-recursive |
| IIR      | Depends on current inputs & past outputs    | Infinite duration    | May be unstable| Recursive     |

> üßÆ FIR filters are easier to design and analyze, while IIR filters are more computationally efficient.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key System Properties

| Property       | Description                                               | Relevance                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Linearity**  | Follows superposition principle (`ax‚ÇÅ + bx‚ÇÇ ‚Üí ay‚ÇÅ + by‚ÇÇ`) | Allows simpler analysis & synthesis      |
| **Time-Invariant** | Behavior does not change with time shift             | Ensures consistency across time          |
| **Causality**  | Output depends only on present and past inputs            | Required for real-time systems           |
| **Stability**  | Bounded input ‚Üí bounded output (BIBO Stability)           | Prevents unbounded or diverging outputs  |
| **Memory**     | Output depends on past input values                       | Needed for systems with feedback         |
| **Invertibility** | Input can be reconstructed from output                 | Essential in communication systems       |

> üìê Most physical systems are causal and time-invariant.
