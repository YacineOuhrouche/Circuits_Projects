## 📊 System Classifications

### 1️⃣ Continuous-Time vs Discrete-Time Systems

| Type             | Description                                     | Example Application           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Continuous-Time  | Operates on signals defined for all `t`         | Analog circuits, RLC systems  |
| Discrete-Time    | Operates on signals defined at intervals `n`    | Digital signal processors (DSP)|

> ⏱️ Discrete-time systems are typically implemented using digital computers or microcontrollers.

### 2️⃣ FIR vs IIR Filters

| Type     | Description                                | Impulse Response     | Stability      | Recursiveness |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| FIR      | Depends only on current & past inputs       | Finite duration      | Always stable  | Non-recursive |
| IIR      | Depends on current inputs & past outputs    | Infinite duration    | May be unstable| Recursive     |

> 🧮 FIR filters are easier to design and analyze, while IIR filters are more computationally efficient.

## ⚙️ Key System Properties

| Property       | Description                                               | Relevance                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Linearity**  | Follows superposition principle (`ax₁ + bx₂ → ay₁ + by₂`) | Allows simpler analysis & synthesis      |
| **Time-Invariant** | Behavior does not change with time shift             | Ensures consistency across time          |
| **Causality**  | Output depends only on present and past inputs            | Required for real-time systems           |
| **Stability**  | Bounded input → bounded output (BIBO Stability)           | Prevents unbounded or diverging outputs  |
| **Memory**     | Output depends on past input values                       | Needed for systems with feedback         |
| **Invertibility** | Input can be reconstructed from output                 | Essential in communication systems       |

> 📐 Most physical systems are causal and time-invariant.

### 3️⃣ Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems

LTI systems are the backbone of signal processing and control analysis due to their simplicity and predictability.

| Feature             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linearity**       | Superposition holds: `T(ax₁ + bx₂) = aT(x₁) + bT(x₂)`                      |
| **Time Invariance** | Output doesn't change if input is delayed: `x(t - t₀) → y(t - t₀)`          |
| **Why Important?**  | LTI systems support convolution, Laplace, Fourier, and Z-transform analysis |

> 🔍 LTI systems make analysis tractable by transforming complex differential/difference equations into algebraic equations.

### 4️⃣ System Order

The **order** of a system refers to the highest derivative (for continuous-time) or delay (for discrete-time) in its defining equation.

| Order            | Description                                | Example              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| First Order      | One energy storage element                 | RC circuit           |
| Second Order     | Two energy storage elements                | RLC circuit          |
| Nth Order        | Higher-order dynamic systems               | Multi-stage filters  |

> 📉 Higher-order systems exhibit more complex dynamic behavior.

### 5️⃣ Frequency Response Classification

Systems may also be categorized by how they respond to different frequency components.

| Type           | Description                            | Application Example         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Low-pass       | Passes low frequencies, attenuates high | Audio tone control          |
| High-pass      | Passes high frequencies                | Edge detection in images    |
| Band-pass      | Passes a certain frequency range        | RF communication            |
| Band-stop      | Attenuates a specific band              | Notch filter for interference|

> 🧠 Frequency response is critical in filter design and system stability analysis.

| **Impulse**   | Sudden spike (δ(t))            | Impulse response analysis   |
| **Step**      | Sudden jump (u(t))             | Stability and settling time |
| **Ramp**      | Linearly increasing input      | Tracking and lag analysis   |

> 🎯 Common in simulations and control design (e.g., PID tuning).
