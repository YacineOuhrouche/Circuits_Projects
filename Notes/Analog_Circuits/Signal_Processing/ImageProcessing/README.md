# 📸 Image Processing

## ✨ Introduction

**Image Processing** involves manipulating images to extract useful information, improve visual quality, or prepare data for machine perception. It is fundamental in fields like **computer vision**, **medical imaging**, **robotics**, and **surveillance**.

Common operations include **filtering**, **compression**, **feature extraction**, and **enhancement**, each with specific algorithms and hardware/software implementations.

## 🧹 Image Filtering

> Filtering is used to smooth, sharpen, or detect features like edges in an image by modifying pixel values based on their neighbors.

### 🔧 How It Works

- An image is processed using a **convolution kernel** (a small matrix) that is slid over the image.
- Each output pixel is a **weighted sum** of the neighboring pixels defined by the kernel.
- Filters can be **linear** (e.g., blur, sharpen) or **non-linear** (e.g., median filter).

### ⚙️ Internal Components

- **Convolution Engine**: Performs pixel-wise convolution using kernels.
- **Buffers/Registers**: Store local pixel neighborhoods.
- **Edge Handling**: Zero-padding or boundary mirroring techniques.

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Blurring for noise reduction
- Sharpening for enhancing details
- Edge detection (e.g., Sobel, Canny)

| ✅ Pros                          | ❌ Cons                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Simple to implement              | Can be sensitive to noise                |
| Versatile for many applications | May increase computational load          |

## 📦 Image Compression

> Reduces the amount of data required to store or transmit an image by eliminating redundancy or irrelevant information.

### 🔧 How It Works

- **Lossless compression**: Reduces file size without losing any data (e.g., PNG, Huffman coding).
- **Lossy compression**: Removes perceptually insignificant details (e.g., JPEG, DCT, WebP).
- Common techniques include **transformation**, **quantization**, and **entropy coding**.

### ⚙️ Internal Components

- **Transform Block**: DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), Wavelets.
- **Quantizer**: Reduces precision of transformed values.
- **Entropy Encoder**: Huffman or Arithmetic coding.

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Web image delivery (JPEG, WebP)
- Storage in mobile or embedded systems
- Transmission in surveillance or satellite imaging

| ✅ Pros                          | ❌ Cons                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Reduces storage and bandwidth    | Lossy formats degrade quality           |
| Fast decoding for real-time use  | Complex encoding may require hardware   |

## 🧠 Feature Extraction

> Identifies and describes **distinct patterns or regions** in an image that are useful for tasks like recognition, classification, and tracking.

### 🔧 How It Works

- Detects **edges**, **corners**, or **blobs** (regions of interest).
- Converts these into **feature vectors** using descriptors (e.g., SIFT, ORB, HOG).
- These vectors are used for tasks like image matching or object detection.

### ⚙️ Internal Components

- **Detectors**: Harris Corner, FAST, Canny for identifying keypoints.
- **Descriptors**: SIFT, SURF, ORB for describing keypoints.
- **Normalization Unit**: Ensures invariance to scale and rotation.

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Face detection and recognition
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

| ✅ Pros                          | ❌ Cons                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Crucial for machine vision       | Sensitive to image quality changes      |
| Enables object recognition       | High-complexity for real-time systems   |

## 🌟 Image Enhancement

> Improves the visual appearance of an image or prepares it for further analysis.

### 🔧 How It Works

- Techniques modify contrast, brightness, sharpness, or remove defects.
- **Histogram equalization** spreads intensity values for better contrast.
- **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) avoids over-enhancement.
- Sharpening filters enhance edges.

### ⚙️ Internal Components

- **Histogram Analyzer**: Computes pixel intensity distribution.
- **Lookup Table (LUT)**: Maps old pixel values to enhanced ones.
- **Adaptive Enhancers**: Use local contrast for better results.

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Medical imaging (X-ray, MRI)
- Satellite/aerial image preprocessing
- Night vision and low-light image enhancement

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                                  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Improves image visibility          | Can amplify noise or artifacts           |
| Enhances details for analysis      | May distort original image interpretation|
