# 🔊 Audio Processing

## ✨ Introduction

**Audio Processing** involves analyzing and modifying audio signals to improve quality, extract information, or produce new sound effects. Techniques like **compression**, **equalization**, **noise reduction**, and **synthesis** are widely used in **music production**, **telecommunications**, **hearing aids**, and **embedded systems**.

## 🎚️ Audio Compression

> Compression reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal — the difference between the quietest and loudest parts — to make it more balanced or to save bandwidth/storage.

### 🔧 How It Works

- A **compressor** continuously monitors the amplitude of an audio signal.
- If the signal exceeds a set **threshold**, it reduces the gain by a certain **ratio** (e.g., 4:1).
- **Attack** and **release** controls define how fast the compressor responds to changes.

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Broadcasting (to prevent clipping)
- Music mixing (leveling vocals/instruments)
- Audio codecs (MP3, AAC)

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                               |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Reduces volume spikes              | Can cause distortion if overused      |
| Balances audio for better clarity  | May lose natural dynamics             |

## 🎚️ Equalization (EQ)

> EQ is used to adjust the balance between frequency components of an audio signal — boosting or cutting specific bands.

### 🔧 How It Works

- An audio signal is passed through **filters** that isolate frequency bands (bass, mid, treble).
- Gain is adjusted per band to shape the sound profile.


### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Bass boost in headphones
- Vocal clarity enhancement
- Noise removal in specific bands

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Fine-tuned control of frequency   | Can color the sound too much          |
| Essential in audio mastering      | Misuse can degrade audio quality      |

## 🔇 Noise Reduction

> Removes or attenuates unwanted background noise from an audio signal.

### 🔧 How It Works

- **Spectral subtraction**: Estimates and subtracts noise profile from the signal.
- **Adaptive filtering**: Filters learn and cancel predictable noise (e.g., hum).
- **Gating**: Cuts audio below a certain amplitude threshold.

### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Speech enhancement in VoIP
- Audio restoration in old recordings
- Hearing aids and assistive devices

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                               |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Improves clarity in noisy signals  | Risk of over-suppressing desired sound |
| Effective in real-time applications| Complexity increases with accuracy     |

## 🎼 Sound Synthesis

> Generates new sounds from scratch using mathematical models or pre-recorded samples.

### 🔧 How It Works

- **Additive synthesis**: Adds sine waves of different frequencies.
- **Subtractive synthesis**: Starts with a rich waveform and removes frequencies.
- **FM synthesis**: Modulates one signal with another to create complex tones.
- **Sample-based**: Plays back recorded audio at different pitches.


### 🧭 Typical Uses

- Music synthesizers (hardware/software)
- Video game sound design
- Procedural audio in films and AR/VR

| ✅ Pros                           | ❌ Cons                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Can generate any desired sound  | Can be computationally intensive         |
| Fully programmable sound design | Requires expertise in synthesis methods  |
