# 🌐 Global Internet Access via Satellite

---

## ✨ Introduction

Global internet access via satellite enables broadband connectivity in remote, rural, and underserved regions where terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or cost-prohibitive. This system uses satellites—often in **LEO (Low Earth Orbit)** or **GEO (Geostationary Orbit)**—to bridge the digital divide and provide global coverage.

---

## 📡 How It Works

Satellites act as **relay stations**, transmitting internet signals between **ground stations** and **user terminals**. Data is sent via **uplink** from a ground station to a satellite, and then **downlinked** to the user’s satellite dish or antenna.

### 🔁 Communication Flow:
User Terminal ⇄ Satellite ⇄ Ground Gateway ⇄ Internet Backbone
