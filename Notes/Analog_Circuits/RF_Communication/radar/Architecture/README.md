# 🧠 Radar Architectures & Topologies

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Radar Architectures** define how radar transmitters and receivers are arranged in space and how they interact to detect and track targets. From the classic **monostatic** setup to advanced **phased array** and **multistatic** configurations, each architecture brings trade-offs in complexity, range, stealth, and resolution.

Understanding these architectures is essential for designing systems tailored to specific operational needs—be it surveillance, navigation, targeting, or weather monitoring.

## 🧩 Major Radar Configurations

### 1️⃣ **Monostatic Radar**

> Transmitter and receiver share the same location or antenna.

- 📌 **Usage**: Most common radar architecture.
- ⚙️ **Operation**: A pulse is transmitted, and reflections are received at the same site.

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                              |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Simple hardware design             | Vulnerable to jamming                |
| Easy signal synchronization        | Clutter near antenna complicates processing |
| Compact and cost-effective         | Limited in stealth detection         |

### 2️⃣ **Bistatic Radar**

> Transmitter and receiver are located at different places.

- 📌 **Usage**: Surveillance, counter-stealth applications.
- ⚙️ **Operation**: Radar signal is transmitted from one location and received at another, forming a bistatic angle.

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Can detect stealth targets         | Requires precise synchronization        |
| Enhanced angular coverage          | Complex geometry and tracking math      |
| Increased survivability            | Difficult to calibrate and align        |

### 3️⃣ **Multistatic Radar**

> Multiple receivers (and/or transmitters) spatially distributed.

- 📌 **Usage**: Covert detection, anti-stealth, over-the-horizon.
- ⚙️ **Operation**: A network of radar nodes cooperatively tracks targets.

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| High detection probability         | Very complex signal processing            |
| Robust to jamming and evasion      | Synchronization challenges across nodes   |
| Enables wide-area coverage         | High cost and system integration effort   |

### 4️⃣ **Phased Array Radar**

> Uses electronically steerable antenna arrays for beamforming.

- 📌 **Usage**: Air defense, weather radar, advanced tracking.
- ⚙️ **Operation**: Phases of antenna elements are controlled to steer beams without moving parts.

| ✅ Pros                              | ❌ Cons                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Ultra-fast beam steering            | Expensive to build and maintain          |
| Multiple target tracking            | Complex calibration and thermal control  |
| High reliability (no moving parts)  | Requires advanced control electronics    |
