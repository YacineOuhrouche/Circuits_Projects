# 🌐 Modulation & Demodulation

Welcome to the **Modulation & Demodulation** repository! 🎉  
This collection features circuits that **encode and decode information** onto carrier signals for transmission over RF channels. These techniques are foundational for wireless communication systems such as radio, television, and digital data networks.
