# 🌀 Balun Circuits

---

## ✨ Introduction

A **Balun** (short for **Balanced-Unbalanced transformer**) is a crucial passive component in RF and communication systems. It enables the transition between **balanced** (differential) and **unbalanced** (single-ended) signal formats — ensuring optimal signal integrity, impedance matching, and noise suppression.

- A **Balanced** line carries signals on two conductors with equal and opposite voltages.
- An **Unbalanced** line uses one conductor and ground as the return path (e.g., coaxial cable).

---

## 🔹 Purpose of Baluns

- ✅ Convert signals between **balanced and unbalanced** formats.
- ✅ Match impedance between different transmission lines (e.g., 300Ω ↔ 75Ω).
- ✅ Reduce **common-mode noise** and **interference**.
- ✅ Improve power transfer and signal fidelity in high-frequency systems.

## 📦 Types of Balun Circuits

### 1️⃣ **Voltage Balun**

> A **Voltage Balun** is designed to match the **voltage** between balanced and unbalanced lines. It typically uses a transformer to convert the voltage ratio between the lines.

- ⚙️ **How it works**:  
  A voltage Balun transforms the voltage ratio between the balanced and unbalanced lines while ensuring the impedance is matched. It is used when the voltage difference between the two lines is critical.

- 🧭 **Typical Use**:
  - Antenna feeds
  - Low-impedance systems
