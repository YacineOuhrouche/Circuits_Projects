# 📡 Multiple Access Techniques

---

## ✨ Introduction

Multiple access techniques are essential in satellite communication for enabling **multiple users or services to share the same satellite channel** efficiently. These techniques divide the available resources — such as **frequency, time, code, or space** — to avoid interference and optimize bandwidth usage across numerous simultaneous transmissions.

---

## 🔹 Purpose of Multiple Access

- ✅ **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Share limited satellite bandwidth among many users.
- ✅ **Interference Management**: Prevent signal overlap and collisions.
- ✅ **Scalability**: Allow more users to connect simultaneously.
- ✅ **Support for Diverse Applications**: Voice, video, data, and telemetry.

## 📦 Types of Multiple Access Techniques

---

### 1️⃣ **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**

> Divides available bandwidth into smaller frequency bands, each assigned to a different user or channel.

> **Applications**:  
- Traditional analog telephony  
- Legacy satellite voice/data links

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Simple implementation             | Fixed bandwidth — low flexibility |
| Minimal latency                   | Poor spectral efficiency          |
| Continuous transmission           | Requires filtering and guard bands|

### 2️⃣ **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**

> Allocates unique time slots to users over the same frequency, allowing users to transmit in turns.

> **Applications**:  
- Digital satellite TV  
- Satellite internet access  
- VSAT networks

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| High spectral efficiency          | Requires time synchronization     |
| Dynamic allocation of resources   | Idle slots waste bandwidth        |
| Easier power control              | Switching delays in real-time apps|

### 3️⃣ **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**

> All users share the same frequency and time, but each is assigned a unique code to modulate their signal (spread spectrum).

> **Applications**:  
- GPS and GNSS systems  
- Military satellite communication  
- Mobile communication (3G)

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| High resistance to interference   | Complex signal processing          |
| Good for secure communications   | Code management required           |
| Supports many users simultaneously| High power consumption             |

### 4️⃣ **SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access)**

> Users are separated by **spatial positioning**, such as using narrow, directional beams to serve different ground locations.

> **Applications**:  
- High-throughput satellites (HTS)  
- Spot beam coverage systems

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                            | ❌ Cons                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Efficient frequency reuse         | Requires beamforming technology    |
| High capacity per region          | Higher antenna system complexity   |
| Less inter-user interference      | Limited to satellite beam footprint|
