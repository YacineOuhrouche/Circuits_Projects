# CMOS NOT Gate Using PMOS & NMOS Transistors

## 📝 What It Does

A **CMOS NOT gate** (inverter) outputs the **opposite** of the input. It uses complementary MOS transistors — a **PMOS** and an **NMOS** — to perform this operation efficiently.

- Input `HIGH` (1) gives output `LOW` (0)
- Input `LOW` (0) gives output `HIGH` (1)

## ⚙️ How It Works with CMOS Transistors

This NOT gate uses a **PMOS** transistor (connected to VDD) and an **NMOS** transistor (connected to GND).

- When **A = 0**, PMOS turns **ON** and pulls the output to **VDD** (high).
- When **A = 1**, NMOS turns **ON** and pulls the output to **GND** (low).

This complementary action achieves reliable switching with low power consumption — a hallmark of **CMOS logic**.
