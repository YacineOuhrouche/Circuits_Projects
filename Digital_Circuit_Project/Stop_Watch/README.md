# ⏱️ Digital Stopwatch Project

Welcome to the **Digital Stopwatch Project**! This project implements a fully functional **digital stopwatch** using basic digital components and a microcontroller. The stopwatch can track time in **hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds**, with start, stop, and reset functionality.

## 📜 Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple **digital stopwatch** that displays the time on an **LED display** or **LCD screen**. The project uses a **microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino or similar), **timers**, and external components like **push buttons** and **7-segment displays** to build a working stopwatch that can:
- **Start** counting the time
- **Stop** or **pause** the count
- **Reset** the count to zero

## 🎯 Features
- **Start/Stop/Reset Control**: Operated via push buttons to control the stopwatch.
- **Time Display**: Shows the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- **Accurate Timing**: Utilizes hardware timers to ensure precise counting.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend for additional features or displays.



## 💻 How It Works

1. **Start/Stop Operation**: Press the start button to begin counting time. Press it again to stop or pause the stopwatch.
2. **Reset Operation**: The reset button clears the current time and resets the display to 00:00:00.
3. **Timer Implementation**: The microcontroller uses an internal hardware timer to measure the elapsed time accurately.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Adding a **Lap Time** feature to record intervals.
- Integrating a **display backlight** for better visibility.
- Converting to an **OLED display** for a more modern look.
- Adding a **buzzer** to sound when specific time intervals are reached.
