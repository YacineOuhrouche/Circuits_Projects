# ⏱️ Digital Stopwatch Project 

Welcome to the **Digital Stopwatch Project**! This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional **digital stopwatch** using **555 timers** along with other basic digital components like counters and flip-flops. The stopwatch can track time in **seconds** and can be easily expanded for more precision.

## 📜 Overview

This project uses **555 timers** in **astable mode** to generate clock pulses, which are then fed into a **counter circuit**. The output of the counter drives **7-segment displays** or **LEDs** to display the elapsed time. You can control the stopwatch using **push buttons** to **start**, **stop**, and **reset** the time.

## 📌 Prerequisites
Before building this circuit, it’s helpful to have a basic understanding of:
- **[Logic Gates](../../Digital_Circuit/Logic_Gates)**
- **555 Timers**
- **[Decoders](../../Digital_Circuit/Combinational_Circuit/Decoder)**



---

## 🎯 Features
- **Start/Stop/Reset Control**: Operated via push buttons to control the stopwatch.
- **Time Display**: Displays the elapsed time in seconds on a **7-segment display** or **LEDs**.
- **555 Timer-Based Clock Generation**: Uses a 555 timer in astable mode to generate accurate clock pulses.
- **Expandable Design**: The circuit can be modified to measure milliseconds, minutes, or hours by adjusting the counter configuration.



## 💻 How It Works

1. **Clock Generation**: A 555 timer in astable mode generates clock pulses at a precise interval (e.g., 1 second).
2. **Counting Time**: The clock pulses are fed into a **4026 counter**, which increments the count and drives a 7-segment display.
3. **Start/Stop Operation**: Push buttons allow the user to start or stop the counting process.
4. **Reset Operation**: Another push button resets the counter, bringing the display back to 00.
