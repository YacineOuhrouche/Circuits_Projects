# 🔌 Digital Circuit Project

Welcome to the **Digital Circuit Project** repository! 🎉  
This project showcases a range of **digital circuits** built using basic components like **logic gates, flip-flops, and registers**. The primary focus of this project includes circuits such as the **8-bit Binary Counter** and the **8-bit Register**.

The repository includes:

✅ A brief explanation of each circuit's functionality  
✅ Schematic images  
✅ Circuit simulation or breadboard setup
