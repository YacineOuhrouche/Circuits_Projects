# 📡 Propagation Models

## ✨ Introduction

In **wireless communication systems**, **propagation models** are used to estimate how radio waves behave as they travel through space and interact with different environments. These models help predict:

- 📶 Signal strength
- 🌐 Network coverage
- 🚧 Obstacle interference

They're essential for designing reliable systems such as **cellular networks**, **Wi-Fi**, and **satellite communications**.

## 🔍 Why Are Propagation Models Important?

Radio signals experience several phenomena that affect performance:

| 🔎 Phenomenon       | 📋 Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📉 **Path Loss**     | Reduction in signal power over distance.                                        |
| 🔀 **Multipath**      | Signals take multiple paths due to reflection, diffraction, and scattering.    |
| 🎢 **Fading**         | Rapid fluctuations in signal strength due to time or position changes.         |

➡️ These effects must be modeled to **optimize design**, **reduce interference**, and **improve coverage**.

## 🧭 Types of Propagation Models

### 1️⃣ Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL)

> Assumes ideal conditions with no obstacles. Useful for basic line-of-sight calculations.

- 📌 **Use Case**: Satellite links, outdoor point-to-point communication.

| ✅ Pros                      | ❌ Cons                                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Simple to use                | Ignores obstacles and terrain            |
| Good for initial estimation  | Not suitable for real-world environments |

### 2️⃣ Ground Wave Propagation

> Used for low-frequency signals that travel along the Earth's surface.

- 📌 **Use Case**: AM radio, maritime communication.

| ✅ Pros                              | ❌ Cons                                      |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Effective for long-wave signals      | Limited to low frequencies and short ranges  |
| Useful over water or flat terrain    | Attenuation increases with distance          |

### 3️⃣ Sky Wave Propagation

> Utilizes the ionosphere to reflect high-frequency signals back to Earth for long-distance transmission.

- 📌 **Use Case**: Shortwave radio, military HF comms.

| ✅ Pros                               | ❌ Cons                                 |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Enables long-distance comms           | Dependent on ionospheric conditions      |
| Over-the-horizon communication        | Subject to signal fading and distortion  |

### 4️⃣ Okumura-Hata Model

> Empirical model accounting for urban, suburban, and rural environments. Widely used in cellular planning.

- 📌 **Use Case**: Mobile networks, city-wide coverage.

| ✅ Pros                                | ❌ Cons                                |

### 5️⃣ Log-Distance Path Loss Model

> A general-purpose model using a logarithmic decay of signal strength over distance.

- 📌 **Use Case**: Indoor/outdoor planning where precise data isn't available.

| ✅ Pros                             | ❌ Cons                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Easy to implement                   | Requires calibration for each environment |
| Useful for mixed-use environments   | Less accurate in complex terrains        |
