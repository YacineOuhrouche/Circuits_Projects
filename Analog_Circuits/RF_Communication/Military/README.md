| **🔒 Secure Communication (AES, RSA)**      | Ensures encrypted communication channels for military operations.                                   | [View Folder](./Secure_Comm)    |
| **🌐 Spread Spectrum**                      | Distributes the signal over a wider bandwidth, making interception and jamming more difficult.       | [View Folder](./Spread_Sprectrum)|
| **📡 Frequency Hopping**                    | Rapidly changes communication frequencies to avoid jamming and interception.                         | [View Folder](./Frequency_hopping) |
| **⚡ Low Probability of Intercept (LPI)**    | Communication methods that minimize the chance of detection and interception.                        | [View Folder](./LPI)            |
| **📡 MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)**| Uses multiple antennas to send and receive more data simultaneously for increased reliability.        | [View Folder](./MIMO)           |
| **📡 Direction Finding (DF)**               | Techniques for locating the source of transmitted signals, useful for tracking threats.              | [View Folder](./DF)             |
| **🌩️ Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**   | Unintentional disruption of signal transmission caused by external electromagnetic sources.          | [View Folder](./EMI)            |
| **⚠️ Jamming**                              | Actively disrupts communication by injecting interference or noise into the channel.                 | [View Folder](./Jamming)        |
| **🎭 Spoofing**                              | Fakes or mimics legitimate signals (e.g., GPS) to mislead receivers.                                 | [View Folder](./Spoofing)       |
| **🕵️ Deception**                            | Broader strategies to mislead enemy systems using fake signals, decoys, or false data.               | [View Folder](./Deception)      |
| **⛔ Signal Blanking**                      | Temporarily disables or masks signals to prevent interception or tracking.                           | [View Folder](./Signal_Blanking)|
