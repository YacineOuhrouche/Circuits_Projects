# 🔀 Frequency Hopping

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Frequency Hopping** is a spread spectrum technique in which a signal rapidly switches (or "hops") between different frequency channels during transmission. This method improves resistance to interference, enhances security, and allows multiple users to share the same bandwidth with minimal collision.

📶 Widely used in:
- Military communications
- Bluetooth technology
- RFID systems
- GSM cellular networks

## 🎯 Purpose of Frequency Hopping

- ✅ **Interference Avoidance**  
  Reduces the effect of narrowband interference by hopping across multiple frequencies.

- ✅ **Security**  
  Makes unauthorized interception difficult by obscuring the signal’s frequency.

- ✅ **Multi-user Capability**  
  Enables multiple devices to communicate simultaneously without interfering.

- ✅ **Resistance to Jamming**  
  Frequency diversity makes it resilient to intentional jamming attacks.

## 🛠️ Types of Frequency Hopping

### 1️⃣ **Slow Frequency Hopping (SFH)**

> Frequency changes occur at a slower rate than the symbol transmission rate.

- 🔁 Several bits are transmitted per hop.
- 🛡️ Offers **better resistance to fading and jamming**.

**📌 Used in:** Military radios, GSM systems (some modes)

### 2️⃣ **Fast Frequency Hopping (FFH)**

> Frequency changes occur at a faster rate than the symbol transmission rate.

- 🔁 Several hops per bit.
- 🔐 Provides **higher security** and **immunity to narrowband interference**.

**📌 Used in:** High-security systems, radar communication
