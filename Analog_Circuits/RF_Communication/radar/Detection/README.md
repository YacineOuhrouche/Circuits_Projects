# 📍 Target Detection & Ranging

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Target Detection & Ranging** is at the core of radar system functionality. It enables the identification of objects and accurate estimation of their **range**, **velocity**, and **angle of arrival**. Advanced algorithms are used to analyze reflected signals and determine critical target parameters with precision and reliability.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧭 **Range Estimation**: Measure how far a target is from the radar.
- 🚗 **Velocity Measurement**: Determine target speed via Doppler shift.
- 🎯 **Target Detection**: Distinguish targets from noise/clutter.
- 📐 **Angle of Arrival (AoA)**: Estimate direction using antenna arrays.
- 🔄 **Tracking**: Continuously update position and velocity of targets.

## 🧠 Core Algorithms & Techniques

### 1️⃣ **Matched Filtering**

> Maximizes Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for better detection.

- 📌 **Purpose**: Enhance target detectability in noisy environments.
- ⚙️ **Operation**: Correlates received signal with a known template (transmitted waveform).
- 📊 **Used In**: Pulse compression, basic detection processing.

| ✅ Pros                        | ❌ Cons                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Optimal SNR improvement       | Requires exact knowledge of signal |
| Good for weak signals         | Not effective for unknown waveforms |
| Enhances detection range      | Sensitive to Doppler shift       |

### 2️⃣ **Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)**

> Adaptive thresholding for reliable detection under varying noise/clutter.

- 📌 **Purpose**: Maintain consistent probability of false alarms.
- ⚙️ **Operation**: Compares signal power to local background statistics.
- 📊 **Used In**: Target detection in varying clutter/noise environments.

| ✅ Pros                        | ❌ Cons                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Dynamic thresholding          | May miss targets in dense clutter |
| Reduces false alarms          | Computationally intensive         |
| Works in non-stationary noise | Window size impacts performance   |

### 3️⃣ **Range Measurement**

> Calculates distance to target using time delay of return signal.

- 📌 **Purpose**: Determine target location in radial dimension.
- 📊 **Used In**: All radar types (CW, FMCW, pulsed).

| ✅ Pros                    | ❌ Cons                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Straightforward math       | Requires high time resolution    |
| Highly accurate with fast ADCs | Can be affected by multipath     |
| Used in ranging sensors    | Limited resolution at long ranges|
