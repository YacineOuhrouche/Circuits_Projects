# 🎯 Radar Fundamentals

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Radar** (Radio Detection and Ranging) is a system that uses electromagnetic waves—typically radio or microwave frequencies—to detect, locate, and track objects at a distance. By transmitting a signal and analyzing the reflected wave from a target, radar systems can determine an object's position, velocity, and other key characteristics. It plays a pivotal role in defense, weather monitoring, aviation, automotive, and space applications.

## 📌 Core Radar Concepts

### 1️⃣ **Radar Equation**

> Governs the relationship between **transmitted power**, **received power**, **target range**, and **radar cross-section (RCS)**.

$$
P_r = \frac{P_t G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 R^4 L}
$$

- \( P_r \): Received Power  
- \( P_t \): Transmitted Power  
- \( G \): Antenna Gain  
- \( \lambda \): Wavelength  
- \( \sigma \): Radar Cross-Section (RCS)  
- \( R \): Distance to target  
- \( L \): System losses

- 📊 **Purpose**: Helps engineers design radar systems by predicting how much power is reflected back from a target.

### 2️⃣ **Range Resolution**

> The ability of a radar system to **distinguish between two targets** close to each other in distance.

$$
\Delta R = \frac{c}{2B}
$$

- \( \Delta R \): Range resolution  
- \( c \): Speed of light  
- \( B \): Bandwidth of the transmitted signal

- 📌 **Higher bandwidth = Better resolution**

- 🧠 **Use Case**: Crucial in applications like synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and automotive radar for target separation.

---

### 3️⃣ **Doppler Effect**

> The **frequency shift** observed due to **relative motion** between the radar and a moving object.

$$
f_d = \frac{2v}{\lambda}
$$

- \( f_d \): Doppler shift  
- \( v \): Relative velocity  
- \( \lambda \): Wavelength

- 🚗 **Purpose**: Enables the radar to determine the velocity of targets, commonly used in police speed guns, weather radar, and missile tracking.

### 4️⃣ **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)**

> The **rate** at which radar pulses are transmitted, measured in Hz.

- 🔁 **High PRF**: Better for detecting high-velocity targets but can cause range ambiguity.  
- 🎯 **Low PRF**: Better for long-range detection but limited velocity measurement accuracy.

- 📌 **Balancing PRF is critical** to achieving both good range and velocity resolution.

### 5️⃣ **Beamwidth**

> The **angular width** of the radar beam, typically measured between -3 dB points of the main lobe.

$$
\theta_{BW} \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}
$$

- \( \theta_{BW} \): Beamwidth  
- \( \lambda \): Wavelength  
- \( D \): Antenna aperture diameter

- 🎯 **Narrow beamwidth = Better angular resolution**, helps distinguish targets located close in angle.
