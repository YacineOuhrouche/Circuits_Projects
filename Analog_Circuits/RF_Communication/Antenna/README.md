## 📦 Types of Antennas

### 1️⃣ **Dipole Antenna**

> One of the simplest and most widely used antenna designs.

- ⚙️ **How it works**:  
  The dipole antenna consists of two conductive elements, typically metal rods, with a feed at the center. The antenna radiates electromagnetic waves when current flows through it, and it has a **half-wavelength resonance** that makes it efficient at its design frequency.

- 📡 **Applications**:  
  - AM/FM radio
  - Television broadcast
  - Simple communication systems

- ⚖️ **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                     | ❌ Cons                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Simple and cost-effective    | Directional radiation pattern    |
| Easy to design and implement| Requires height for efficient performance |
| Broad bandwidth              | Limited to half-wavelength design |

### 2️⃣ **Monopole Antenna**

> A single-element antenna that is often mounted above a conductive surface (such as a ground plane).

- ⚙️ **How it works**:  
  The monopole antenna functions similarly to the dipole antenna but uses a single conductive element instead of two. The ground plane reflects signals to form a complete radiation pattern, resulting in an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane.

- 📡 **Applications**:  
  - Cellular base stations  
  - Marine communications  
  - Mobile devices

- ⚖️ **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                     | ❌ Cons                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Simple design                | Requires a ground plane         |
| Omnidirectional radiation    | Limited efficiency at higher frequencies |
| Compact design               | Radiation pattern affected by ground conditions |

### 4️⃣ **Parabolic (Dish) Antenna**

> A high-gain, highly directional antenna that uses a parabolic reflector to focus signals.

- ⚙️ **How it works**:  
  The parabolic antenna uses a **parabolic reflector** to focus incoming or outgoing signals to a single focal point. The feed is placed at the focal point of the reflector, and the shape of the reflector ensures a narrow and highly directional beam.
