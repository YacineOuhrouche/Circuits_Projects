# ðŸ“˜ Modulation Techniques 

## âœ¨ Introduction  
Modulation is the process of **altering a carrier signal** to encode information such as voice, video, or data. It is a **core principle in communication systems**, enabling long-distance signal transmission over various media like radio waves, cables, and fiber optics.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Modulation Techniques  
Modulation can be broadly categorized into **analog** and **digital** types:

1. **Analog Modulation**
   - Amplitude Modulation (AM)
   - Frequency Modulation (FM)
   - Phase Modulation (PM)

2. **Digital Modulation**
   - Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
   - Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
   - Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
   - Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
   - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

## ðŸ“Œ Amplitude Modulation (AM)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
In AM, the **amplitude** of a high-frequency carrier signal is varied in proportion to the message signal (modulating signal), while the frequency and phase remain constant.

ðŸ“· **Waveform Example:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- AM Radio
- Airband radio communication

---

## ðŸ“Œ Frequency Modulation (FM)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
In FM, the **frequency** of the carrier is varied according to the message signal, while amplitude remains constant. This provides better noise immunity than AM.

ðŸ“· **Waveform Example:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- FM Radio Broadcasting
- Television Sound Transmission

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase Modulation (PM)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
In PM, the **phase** of the carrier signal is varied based on the modulating signal. PM is closely related to FM and is used in many digital systems.

ðŸ“· **Waveform Example:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- Bluetooth Communication
- Satellite Telemetry

## ðŸ“Œ Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
ASK is a digital modulation where the **amplitude** of the carrier is switched based on binary data. Logic 1 is transmitted by a carrier wave; logic 0 by no carrier.

ðŸ“· **Waveform Example:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- RFID
- Optical Fiber Communication

---

## ðŸ“Œ Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
In FSK, the **frequency** of the carrier is changed according to the digital input. Typically, two distinct frequencies represent 1 and 0.

ðŸ“· **Waveform Example:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- GSM
- Low-bandwidth radio systems

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
PSK alters the **phase** of the carrier signal to represent digital data. Variants like BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK increase data rates.

ðŸ“· **Waveform Example:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- Wi-Fi
- GPS
- Satellite communication

---

## ðŸ“Œ Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
QAM combines **amplitude and phase modulation**, allowing multiple bits to be sent per symbol. For example, 16-QAM transmits 4 bits per symbol.

ðŸ“· **Constellation Diagram:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- 4G/5G LTE
- Cable Modems
- Digital TV

## ðŸ“Œ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**  
OFDM splits the data into multiple subcarriers that are **orthogonal** to each other, reducing interference and increasing spectral efficiency.

ðŸ“· **Block Diagram:**  

ðŸ›  **Applications:**  
- Wi-Fi (802.11)
- LTE
- DVB-T (Digital TV)
