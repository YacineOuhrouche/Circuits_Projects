## ðŸ“Œ Amplitude Modulation (AM)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**, the **amplitude** of a high-frequency **carrier signal** is varied in direct proportion to the **instantaneous value** of the **modulating signal** (such as an audio or video signal). The frequency and phase of the carrier remain constant.

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave that acts as the baseline signal for the transmission.
   
2. **Modulating Signal**: The message or information signal, typically an audio or voice signal, that carries the data to be transmitted.

3. **Modulation Process**: The **amplitude** of the carrier signal changes in response to the instantaneous value of the modulating signal. The modulating signal does not affect the frequency or phase of the carrier.

4. **AM Signal Representation**: The resulting AM signal can be visualized as a high-frequency carrier wave whose amplitude changes in a pattern that mirrors the modulating signal.

### **Key Characteristics**:

- **Bandwidth Requirement**: AM requires bandwidth equal to twice the frequency of the modulating signal.
- **Noise Immunity**: AM is more susceptible to noise compared to FM and other digital modulations.
- **Complexity**: Simple to implement but inefficient in terms of spectrum usage.

### **Pros and Cons**:

## ðŸ“Œ Frequency Modulation (FM)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Frequency Modulation (FM)**, the **frequency** of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the **instantaneous amplitude** of the modulating signal. The amplitude of the carrier remains constant, while its frequency changes based on the input signal's characteristics.

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave that acts as the baseline for the transmission.
   
2. **Modulating Signal**: The message signal, typically an audio or voice signal, that alters the frequency of the carrier signal.

3. **Modulation Process**: The **frequency** of the carrier signal varies proportionally to the amplitude of the modulating signal.

This method of modulation allows for better **noise immunity** than AM, as it is less affected by amplitude noise.


### **Key Characteristics**:

## ðŸ“Œ Phase Modulation (PM)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Phase Modulation (PM)**, the **phase** of the carrier signal is varied based on the instantaneous value of the modulating signal. Like FM, PM is a form of **angle modulation** but focuses on changing the phase instead of the frequency.

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave that acts as the baseline signal.
   
2. **Modulating Signal**: The input signal that affects the phase of the carrier.

3. **Modulation Process**: The **phase** of the carrier is altered in proportion to the modulating signal. The higher the amplitude of the modulating signal, the greater the phase shift.


### **Key Characteristics**:

|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Offers better noise immunity than AM.                 | More complex than AM and FM.                       |

## ðŸ“Œ Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**, the **amplitude** of the carrier wave is varied between different levels to represent binary data (1 and 0). The carrier signal is transmitted at full amplitude for a logic '1', and zero amplitude (no signal) for a logic '0'. 

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave that forms the baseline for transmission.

2. **Modulating Signal**: The digital data that alters the amplitude of the carrier.

3. **Modulation Process**: 
    - When the modulating signal represents a '1', the carrier's amplitude is at maximum.
    - When the modulating signal represents a '0', the carrier's amplitude is set to zero, effectively "turning off" the signal.

### **Key Characteristics**:

- **Bandwidth Requirement**: ASK requires less bandwidth than FM but can be more affected by noise.
- **Noise Immunity**: Very sensitive to noise as amplitude changes can be distorted by interference.
- **Complexity**: Simple to implement, but not suitable for noisy environments.

### **Pros and Cons**:

|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple and inexpensive to implement.                 | Sensitive to noise and interference.                  |
| Suitable for low-speed communication.                | Limited data transmission capacity.                   |

## ðŸ“Œ Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**, the **frequency** of the carrier signal is shifted between two distinct frequencies to represent binary data. One frequency represents a logic '1', and the other represents a logic '0'. 

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave that is shifted in frequency.
   
2. **Modulating Signal**: The binary data, which causes the frequency of the carrier to shift.

3. **Modulation Process**: 
    - The frequency of the carrier is changed between two distinct frequencies to represent binary data.
    - A '1' might be represented by a higher frequency, and a '0' by a lower frequency (or vice versa).


### **Key Characteristics**:

- **Bandwidth Requirement**: FSK requires more bandwidth than ASK but is more robust to noise.
- **Noise Immunity**: FSK is less susceptible to noise compared to ASK.
- **Complexity**: More complex than ASK but provides better performance in noisy environments.

### **Pros and Cons**:

## ðŸ“Œ Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**, the **phase** of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the modulating signal. Different phases represent different bits or symbols in the data.

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave with a specific phase.
   
2. **Modulating Signal**: The binary data that determines the phase of the carrier.

3. **Modulation Process**: 
    - Each phase shift in the carrier wave corresponds to a binary symbol.
    - For example, in **Binary PSK (BPSK)**, the carrier might shift between 0Â° (representing 0) and 180Â° (representing 1).
    - In higher-order PSK, multiple phase shifts can represent more than one bit.


### **Key Characteristics**:

## ðŸ“Œ Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)**, both the **amplitude** and the **phase** of the carrier signal are varied simultaneously to encode multiple bits of data. This allows more bits per symbol compared to simpler modulation schemes like ASK or PSK.

1. **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave with both amplitude and phase components.
   
2. **Modulating Signal**: A digital data stream that modulates both the amplitude and phase.

3. **Modulation Process**: 
    - QAM allows multiple combinations of amplitude and phase to represent multiple bits.
    - For example, in **16-QAM**, each symbol represents 4 bits by varying the amplitude and phase in 16 different ways.

### ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

In **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**, the data is split into several smaller subcarriers, each modulated by a lower data rate signal. These subcarriers are spaced so that they donâ€™t interfere with each other despite being close together in frequency.
