# 🔌 Frequency Generation

Welcome to the **Frequency Generation** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **frequency generation circuits** that produce stable and precise frequencies, essential for RF and communication systems, clock generation, and signal synthesis.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup
