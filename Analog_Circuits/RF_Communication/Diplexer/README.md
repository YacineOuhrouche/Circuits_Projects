# 🔀 Diplexer & Multiplexer Circuits

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Diplexers** and **Multiplexers (MUXes)** are essential components in RF and communication systems that enable the transmission or reception of multiple signals over a shared medium. While both serve to manage multiple signals, they function in different domains:

- A **Diplexer** separates or combines signals based on **frequency**.
- A **Multiplexer** selects one of many input signals to forward to a single output, typically based on **control logic** or **addressing**.

Both are used to **optimize bandwidth, reduce hardware**, and **enable simultaneous communication** across channels.

## 🔹 Purpose of Diplexers

- ✅ Enable multiple signals of different frequencies to share a single path.
- ✅ Separate high and low-frequency signals in RF systems.
- ✅ Reduce the number of antennas or cabling in communication systems.

---

## 🔹 Purpose of Multiplexers

- ✅ Route one of many signals to a single output.
- ✅ Simplify routing in digital systems (e.g., logic, memory addressing).
- ✅ Used in data selection, signal control, and channel sharing.

## 📦 Types of Circuits

### 1️⃣ **Diplexer**

> A passive three-port network that separates or combines signals by frequency.

- ⚙️ **How it works**:  
  A diplexer consists of **low-pass and high-pass filters** that direct signals to different ports depending on their frequency.

- 🧭 **Ports**:
  - **Port 1**: Common port (shared with antenna or transceiver).
  - **Port 2**: Low-frequency port.
  - **Port 3**: High-frequency port.

- 📡 **Applications**:
  - Sharing an antenna between transmit and receive chains.
  - Satellite and cellular communication.
  - TV/Radio combined distribution.

| ✅ Pros                      | ❌ Cons                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Enables frequency-domain signal separation | Limited to fixed frequency bands |
| Passive and low-power         | Needs careful filter design      |

### 2️⃣ **Multiplexer (MUX)**

> A digital or analog circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output line.

- ⚙️ **How it works**:  
  Controlled by **select lines**, the multiplexer routes the desired input to the output.

- 🧭 **Ports**:
  - **Data inputs**: e.g., D0, D1, ..., Dn.
  - **Select lines**: Choose which data input to pass.
  - **Output**: Carries the selected input.

- 📡 **Applications**:
  - Data transmission systems.
  - Microprocessor buses and memory selection.
  - Software-defined radio front-ends.

| ✅ Pros                      | ❌ Cons                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Simplifies routing and control | Limited number of inputs (based on select lines) |
| Efficient use of resources    | Can introduce logic delays       |

## 📊 Frequency Considerations

| Component   | Frequency Domain | Notes                                      |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Diplexer    | RF / Analog       | Frequency separation via passive filters   |
| Multiplexer | Digital / Analog | Logic-controlled selection; clock-bound    |
