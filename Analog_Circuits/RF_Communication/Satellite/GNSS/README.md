# 🌍 Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)

---

## ✨ Introduction

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are satellite-based technologies that enable precise **positioning**, **navigation**, and **timing (PNT)** services across the globe. These systems are crucial for applications ranging from everyday smartphone navigation to military operations, aviation, and geodetic surveying.

GNSS operates by receiving signals from a constellation of satellites and calculating a user's location based on the **time delay** of received signals from multiple sources.

## 🧭 How GNSS Works

1. **Signal Transmission**: Each satellite transmits a signal containing its position and the time of transmission.
2. **Time Delay Measurement**: A GNSS receiver calculates the delay of received signals from multiple satellites.
3. **Triangulation**: Based on at least four satellites, the receiver determines the user’s position (latitude, longitude, altitude) and time.
