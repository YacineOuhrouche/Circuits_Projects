## ✨ Introduction

Satellite communication is an essential technology that enables communication over vast distances, providing services like TV broadcasting, internet access, GPS, and more. It relies on satellites positioned in Earth's orbit to relay signals between ground stations and users. Different satellite types, orbits, and communication techniques are used depending on the specific needs of the application.

## 📦 Types of Satellites

### 1️⃣ **Geostationary Orbit (GEO) Satellites**

> Satellites positioned 35,786 km above the Earth’s equator that maintain a fixed position relative to the surface.

> **Applications**:  
  - TV broadcasting  
  - Weather monitoring  
  - Telecommunications

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                     | ❌ Cons                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Continuous, fixed coverage   | High latency due to distance    |
| Ideal for large-area coverage| Expensive to launch and maintain|
| Stable, predictable signals  | Limited capacity for data transfer|

### 2️⃣ **Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites**

> Satellites orbiting at altitudes ranging from 160 km to 2,000 km above Earth, providing low latency and high data rates.

> **Applications**:  
  - Internet access in remote areas  
  - Earth observation  
  - Military communication

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                     | ❌ Cons                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Low latency and high data speeds | Limited coverage without a constellation |
| Easier to launch and maintain  | Frequent orbital changes required |
| Lower cost compared to GEO   | Requires multiple satellites for global coverage|

### 3️⃣ **Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) Satellites**

> Positioned between LEO and GEO, MEO satellites are primarily used for navigation systems like GPS.

> **Applications**:  
  - Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)  
  - GPS  
  - Galileo navigation system

> **Pros and Cons**:

| ✅ Pros                     | ❌ Cons                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Balance between coverage and latency | Higher latency than LEO satellites|
| Fewer satellites needed for global coverage | Not suitable for real-time communication |

## 🚀 Satellite Orbits

The position of satellites in orbit plays a crucial role in their application and functionality. The main orbits used in satellite communication are:

### 1️⃣ **Geostationary Orbit (GEO)**
- **Altitude**: 35,786 km
- **Features**: Satellite remains stationary relative to Earth, ideal for continuous communication over the same area.
- **Advantages**: No tracking required, predictable signals.
- **Disadvantages**: High latency due to distance, expensive.

### 2️⃣ **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**
- **Altitude**: 160-2,000 km
- **Features**: Satellites orbit quickly, requiring a constellation to provide continuous coverage.
- **Advantages**: Low latency, faster data transfer.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires multiple satellites for global coverage, frequent orbital changes.

### 3️⃣ **Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)**
- **Altitude**: 2,000-35,786 km
- **Features**: Provides a balance of coverage and latency.
- **Advantages**: Suitable for navigation systems like GPS.
- **Disadvantages**: Higher latency than LEO, limited application scope.
