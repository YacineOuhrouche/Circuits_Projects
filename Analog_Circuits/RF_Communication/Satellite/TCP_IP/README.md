# 💬 TCP/IP over Satellite

---

## ✨ Introduction

Traditional **TCP/IP protocols** are optimized for terrestrial networks, where delays are short and packet loss often results from congestion. However, **satellite communication systems** — especially those involving **GEO satellites** — introduce **high latency**, **variable link conditions**, and **non-congestion-related packet loss**. These differences cause conventional TCP/IP to underperform over satellite links.

This section explores the key **challenges** of running TCP/IP over satellite networks and highlights the **modifications and optimization techniques** used to maintain efficient, reliable communication.

## ⚠️ Challenges in Satellite TCP/IP Communication

| 🧩 Challenge                  | 📖 Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Latency**              | GEO satellites introduce ~500 ms round-trip delays, breaking TCP’s congestion algorithms. |
| **High Bandwidth-Delay Product** | TCP struggles to fully utilize bandwidth over long-delay links unless the window size is adjusted. |
| **Packet Loss Misinterpretation** | TCP assumes packet loss means congestion, leading to unnecessary rate throttling. |
| **Bit Error Rate (BER)**     | Satellite links may lose packets due to noise or interference, not congestion. |
| **Asymmetric Links**         | Uplink/downlink speeds may differ, complicating acknowledgment handling. |

## 🛠️ Optimization Techniques

### 1️⃣ **TCP Acceleration (Spoofing)**

> Satellite gateways intercept and terminate TCP connections locally, handling satellite-specific optimizations internally.

- **Improves throughput**
- **Reduces handshake delay**
- Often used in satellite modems and ground terminals

### 2️⃣ **Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs)**

> Specialized proxies split the TCP connection at the satellite gateway, applying custom flow control, retransmission, and acknowledgment techniques optimized for satellite links.

| ✅ Advantages                         | ❌ Limitations                        |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Boosts TCP efficiency over long links| Breaks end-to-end security (e.g., TLS/SSL) |
| Can apply compression and caching    | Requires specialized equipment       |

### 3️⃣ **Window Scaling & SACK**

> TCP enhancements like **Window Scaling** and **Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)** are critical in high-latency environments.

- **Window Scaling** allows TCP to use large windows (>64 KB) to keep more data "in flight"
- **SACK** allows retransmission of only the missing packets rather than whole sequences

### 4️⃣ **UDP-Based Protocols for Real-Time Apps**

> Real-time applications like VoIP, video conferencing, and streaming avoid TCP altogether by using **UDP** with application-layer reliability (e.g., **RTP**, **QUIC**).

- No retransmission delays
- Suitable for low-latency audio/video

## 📌 Applications

- ✅ **Remote internet access** (Starlink, Viasat, HughesNet)
- ✅ **Military and defense networks**
- ✅ **Offshore communication systems**
- ✅ **Telemedicine and emergency response systems**

## 🔚 Conclusion

Optimizing **TCP/IP for satellite communication** is essential to ensure high throughput and reliable service. By implementing performance-enhancing techniques such as **TCP acceleration**, **window scaling**, and **PEPs**, modern satellite systems can deliver performance comparable to terrestrial networks, even across vast distances and under challenging link conditions.
