# 🎚️ Automatic Gain Control (AGC)

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Automatic Gain Control (AGC)** is an essential circuit technique used in **communication systems, radar, audio processing, and signal acquisition chains** to automatically regulate the amplitude of an input signal. Its main purpose is to maintain a consistent output level, even if the input signal strength varies widely over time.

---

## 🔹 Purpose of AGC

- **Maintain Signal Consistency**: Stabilizes signal amplitude for optimal processing.
- **Prevent Overload**: Protects downstream circuits (like ADCs or demodulators) from being overdriven.
- **Improve Dynamic Range Handling**: Automatically adapts to strong and weak signals.
- **Enable Robust Reception**: Vital in RF systems for dealing with fluctuating received signal strength.

## ⚙️ How AGC Works

AGC systems monitor the **output amplitude** of a signal chain and adjust the **gain** of an amplifier accordingly:

1. **Input Signal** enters the system with unknown amplitude.
2. **Detector/Envelope Follower** monitors the output level.
3. **Gain Control Loop** compares this with a reference level.
4. **Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)** is adjusted to increase or decrease gain, keeping the output stable.

AGC can be implemented in **analog**, **digital**, or **hybrid** domains depending on the system.
