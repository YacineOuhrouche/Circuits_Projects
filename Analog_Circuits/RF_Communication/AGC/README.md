# 🎚️ Automatic Gain Control (AGC)

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Automatic Gain Control (AGC)** is a foundational circuit used in **communication systems, radar, audio processing, and sensor interfaces** to automatically regulate the **amplitude of incoming signals**. Its primary function is to ensure a **stable output level**, even when the input signal strength fluctuates significantly.

---

## 🔹 Purpose of AGC

- 🎯 **Maintain Signal Consistency**: Keeps output amplitude constant despite input variations.
- 🛡️ **Prevent Overload**: Protects sensitive stages (ADCs, demodulators) from excessive signal levels.
- 📶 **Improve Dynamic Range**: Adapts to weak and strong signals automatically.
- 📡 **Enable Robust Reception**: Especially crucial in RF systems and fluctuating wireless environments.

## ⚙️ How AGC Works

AGC operates using a **closed-loop feedback system** that monitors and adjusts the gain of an amplifier:

1. 🎧 **Input Signal** arrives with unknown or varying amplitude.
2. 🪞 **Detector or Envelope Follower** measures the output level.
3. ⚖️ **Control Loop** compares it with a reference level.
4. 🎛️ **Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)** adjusts gain up or down to stabilize output.

> AGC can be built in **analog**, **digital**, or **hybrid** domains depending on the application.
