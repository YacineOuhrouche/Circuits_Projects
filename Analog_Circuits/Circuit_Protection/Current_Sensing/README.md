# 📘 Current Sensing Circuits 

## ✨ Introduction  
Current sensing circuits are essential for measuring and monitoring the flow of electrical current in a circuit. They are widely used for overcurrent protection, battery management systems, power supplies, and current feedback in control systems. These circuits **convert current** into a measurable voltage signal that can be monitored and analyzed.

## 🔹 Types of Current Sensing Circuits  
There are several types of current sensing circuits, each suited to different applications and measuring methods:

1. **Shunt Resistor Current Sensing**
2. **Hall Effect Current Sensing**
3. **Current Transformer Sensing**

## 📌 Shunt Resistor Current Sensing

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **low-value resistor** (shunt resistor) is placed in series with the load.
- The voltage drop across the resistor is proportional to the current flowing through the circuit, based on Ohm’s Law (V = IR).
- This voltage drop is then amplified and measured to calculate the current.

### ✅ Applications:  
✔️ **Battery Management Systems** – Measures current flow for charging and discharging.  
✔️ **Power Supplies** – Monitors current to regulate output.

## 📌 Hall Effect Current Sensing

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- The **Hall effect sensor** detects the magnetic field generated by the current flow through a conductor.
- The sensor produces a voltage proportional to the magnetic field, which is then converted into a current measurement.
- This method allows for **non-invasive current sensing**, meaning the conductor doesn’t need to be physically interrupted.

### ✅ Applications:  
✔️ **AC and DC Current Measurement** – Non-invasive measurement of current.  
✔️ **Motor Control** – Used in electric motors for current feedback.

## 📌 Current Transformer Sensing

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **current transformer (CT)** consists of a primary winding, which carries the current to be measured, and a secondary winding that produces a proportional voltage.
- The current flowing through the primary winding induces a current in the secondary winding, which can then be measured to calculate the primary current.
