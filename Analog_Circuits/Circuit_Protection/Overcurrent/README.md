## 📌 Fuse-Based Overcurrent Protection

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **fuse** is placed in series with the load.
- When current exceeds the fuse’s rated value, the fuse **melts**, disconnecting the circuit and preventing damage to the system.

## 📌 Current Limiting Diode (CLD) Overcurrent Protection

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **Current Limiting Diode (CLD)** is placed in the circuit to limit the current flow.
- When the current exceeds the preset limit, the diode **clamps** the current, preventing it from rising beyond the safe threshold.

## 📌 Relay-Based Overcurrent Protection

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- A **relay** is used to monitor the current flowing through the circuit.
- When the current exceeds the preset threshold, the relay **opens**, disconnecting the load and preventing overcurrent damage.

**👉[More About Relays](https://eshop.se.com/in/blog/post/understanding-overcurrent-relays.html#:~:text=An%20overcurrent%20relay%20is%20a,faulty%20part%20of%20the%20system.)**

### ✅ Applications:
- ✔️ **Home Appliances** – Protects household devices like refrigerators or washing machines from overcurrent.
- ✔️ **Industrial Applications** – Used to protect large equipment and machinery from overcurrent.
