# 🛡️ RF Shielding Circuits

---

## ✨ Introduction

**RF (Radio Frequency) shielding** involves techniques used to isolate sensitive electronic circuits from unwanted electromagnetic interference (EMI) or to prevent RF signals from leaking out of a system. It plays a critical role in maintaining **signal integrity**, **circuit stability**, and **regulatory compliance** in high-frequency and communication systems.

Shielding is achieved using **conductive enclosures**, **filter circuits**, **grounding techniques**, and **specialized PCB layouts** to block or redirect RF energy.

## 🎯 Purpose of RF Shielding

- 🧲 **Prevent EMI Interference**: Block external RF signals from interfering with sensitive circuit components.
- 🚫 **Contain Internal Radiation**: Prevent devices from emitting RF noise that could affect nearby equipment.
- ⚖️ **Meet Regulatory Standards**: Comply with EMC/EMI regulations (e.g., FCC, CE).
- 🔒 **Improve Security**: Protect military or confidential RF systems from eavesdropping and leakage.
