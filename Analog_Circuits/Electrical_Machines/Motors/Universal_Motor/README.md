# ⚙️ Universal Motor

## ✨ Introduction

A **Universal Motor** is a type of electric motor that can **operate on both AC and DC power sources**. It is essentially a **series-wound brushed motor**, meaning that the **stator and rotor windings are connected in series**, and it relies on **commutation via brushes and a commutator**.

These motors are valued for their **high-speed operation**, **compact design**, and **ability to deliver high starting torque**, making them perfect for portable appliances and power tools.

## 🔹 Purpose of Universal Motors

- 🔋 **Dual Compatibility** – Runs on both AC and DC power supplies.
- ⚡ **High Torque & Speed** – Ideal for applications requiring high RPM.
- 🧰 **Compactness** – Suitable for handheld or space-constrained designs.
- 🪚 **Cost-Effective Power** – Found in low-cost, high-output consumer products.

## ⚙️ How It Works

A Universal Motor has **field windings in series** with the **armature (rotor) winding**. This configuration causes the motor to produce **high starting torque**.

- 🔁 When **AC is applied**, the **field and armature currents alternate together**, so torque remains unidirectional.
- 🔌 When **DC is applied**, it functions like a typical **series DC motor**.
- 🧹 A **commutator and brush system** keeps the current flowing in the correct direction in the armature winding, regardless of AC or DC input.

Because of the series connection and commutator design, these motors can reach very high speeds (up to 20,000 RPM), but often require **speed limiting** or **cooling mechanisms**.
