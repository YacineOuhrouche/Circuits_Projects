# 🎛️ Active High Pass Filter

Welcome to the **Active High Pass Filter (HPF)** project repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates how to design and build an **Active High Pass Filter (HPF)** — an important circuit in analog electronics.

## 🧰 What is an Active High Pass Filter?

An **Active High Pass Filter** is an electronic circuit that **allows high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating (blocking) low-frequency signals**, and it **uses active components like op-amps** for enhanced performance. Unlike passive filters, an active HPF can provide **gain**, **steeper roll-offs**, and the ability to **drive loads** directly.

## 🛠️ What Does It Do?

The Active High Pass Filter is used for:

✅ **Filtering low-frequency noise** from signals  
✅ **Amplifying high-frequency components** in audio or sensor signals  
✅ **Extracting high-frequency components** (e.g., separating high-frequency data from noise)  
✅ **Signal conditioning** in communication and audio systems

## ⚙️ Circuit Explanation

This is an **Active High Pass Filter (HPF)**, built using:

- **Op-amp (Operational Amplifier)**
- **Resistors (R)**
- **Capacitors (C)**

By utilizing an op-amp, the circuit can provide **gain**, achieve a **steeper cutoff**, and work better than passive filters in many situations, particularly with higher frequency selections.

## 🌍 Cutoff Frequency Calculation

The cutoff frequency of an **Active High Pass Filter** is determined by the resistor and capacitor values, calculated as:

    F_c = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C)

Where:
- **F_c** is the cutoff frequency in Hz.
- **R** is the resistance in ohms.
- **C** is the capacitance in farads.

The cutoff frequency marks the point where the filter begins to attenuate lower frequencies and allow higher ones to pass.

## 💻 Applications

- **Audio Processing**: Used to eliminate low-frequency hum or rumble in audio systems.
- **Sensor Signal Conditioning**: Filters out low-frequency noise or drift in sensor readings.
- **Signal Filtering in Communication Systems**: Allows high-frequency components of a signal to pass while blocking unwanted low-frequency noise.
- **High-Pass Filtering in Power Supplies**: Used to remove low-frequency ripple and smooth out DC signals.
