# 🔌 Analog Circuits

Welcome to the **Analog Circuits** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **basic analog circuits** using components like **diodes, resistors, capacitors, and transistors**. Analog circuits process real-world signals, such as sound, light, and temperature, making them essential in many electronic applications.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup
