# ‚ö° Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

## ‚ú® Introduction

**Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to a load by varying the width of the pulses in a signal. It is widely used for applications such as motor control, LED dimming, and power regulation. PWM allows efficient control over devices while minimizing energy loss.

PWM works by switching the signal on and off at a high frequency. The **duty cycle** of the signal determines how much power is delivered to the load.

## üîπ How PWM Works

PWM involves varying the **duty cycle** of a square wave signal, which represents the percentage of time the signal is on versus off within a fixed time period.

- **Duty Cycle**: The percentage of time the signal is HIGH (on).
- **Frequency**: The number of PWM cycles per second (e.g., 1 kHz, 10 kHz).

> A higher duty cycle = more power delivered.

## üîπ PWM Control

- **Duty Cycle**: Adjusting the duty cycle controls the power delivered to the load. A higher duty cycle results in more power being delivered, while a lower duty cycle reduces power.
- **Frequency**: The frequency of the PWM signal determines how fast the signal switches between on and off states. Typically, PWM frequencies range from 1 kHz to several MHz, depending on the application.
