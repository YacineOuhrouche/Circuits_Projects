## 📌 AC-AC Voltage Controller Converter (AC Choppers) 🔄

🔹 **How It Works:**
- **AC Choppers** (also known as **AC Voltage Controllers**) are used to control the AC voltage supplied to a load.
- They achieve this by varying the conduction period of an AC signal, thereby controlling the effective RMS voltage.
- **Phase-controlled thyristors** or **triacs** adjust the duty cycle, allowing precise voltage regulation.
- These converters operate by allowing or blocking portions of the AC waveform, maintaining sinusoidal characteristics but reducing effective power.

## 📌 AC Cycloconverter 🔄➡️

🔹 **How It Works:**
- Converts an input AC voltage of one frequency to an output AC voltage of a **lower frequency**.
- Unlike traditional converters, **no intermediate DC link** is needed.
- Uses **SCRs (Silicon-Controlled Rectifiers)** or **thyristors** arranged in a bridge configuration to control output frequency.
- Each half-cycle of the input waveform is selectively passed through controlled switching, reducing frequency while maintaining sinusoidal characteristics.
- Commonly used for **high-power applications**.
