# 🎵 Two-Stage Class A Audio Amplifier Project 🔊

## Overview 🚀
This project is a **two-stage Class A audio amplifier**, designed to increase the amplitude of an audio signal while maintaining its integrity. Audio amplifiers are widely used in various applications, such as speakers, headphones, and communication devices, to enhance sound output.

This design consists of **two cascaded common-emitter (CE) amplifier stages** to **increase both voltage and power** of the signal. Class A amplifiers are known for their **high linearity** and **low distortion**, making them ideal for high-fidelity applications.

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before building this circuit, you should be familiar with:

- **[Small Signal Amplifier](../../BJT_Circuits/Small_Signal_Amplifier)**
- **[Power Amplifier](../../BJT_Circuits/Power_Amplifier)**

## How the Signal is Amplified ⚡
In a **two-stage common-emitter amplifier**, the signal undergoes two amplification stages:

1. **First Stage (Voltage Amplification - Common-Emitter Amplifier)**  
   - The input audio signal is weak and requires initial amplification.
   - A **small-signal transistor** in **common-emitter configuration** is used to **boost the voltage** of the signal.
   - The **output is inverted** with respect to the input due to the CE configuration.
   - This stage provides **high voltage gain**, ensuring the signal is strong enough for the next stage.

2. **Second Stage (Power Amplification - Common-Emitter Amplifier)**  
   - The amplified voltage signal is passed to a **second CE amplifier**, which further amplifies the signal and increases the current.
   - This stage is designed to **drive the speaker**, ensuring sufficient power output.
   - **A capacitor-coupled output** is used to block DC components and pass only the amplified AC audio signal.

### 🎛️ Working Principle:
1. 🎤 The input signal is fed into the **first common-emitter amplifier**.
2. 📢 The first stage **increases the voltage** of the signal while inverting it.
3. 🎚️ The amplified signal is sent to the **second common-emitter amplifier**, which boosts both voltage and current.
4. 🔋 The second stage **drives the speaker**, ensuring proper sound output.
5. 🔊 The amplified signal is sent to the **speaker** for sound output.
