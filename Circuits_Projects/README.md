# 🔌 Analog Circuit Project

Welcome to the **Analog Circuit Project** repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates how to build a basic **analog circuit** using components like **diodes, resistors, capacitors, and transistors**. The primary focus of this project is the **LED Flasher** circuit, which uses **Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)** to blink an LED periodically.

The repository includes:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ Schematic image  
✅ Circuit simulation or breadboard setup

## 💡 LED Flasher
**What It Does:**  
This circuit uses two **BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)** to blink an LED periodically. The flashing rate is controlled by resistors and capacitors, creating a basic **astable multivibrator**.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **Capacitor charging and discharging**
- **Transistor switching**
- **Timing circuits**
