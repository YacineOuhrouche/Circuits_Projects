## 📉 Moore's Law & Technology Scaling

> **Moore’s Law** states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every 18–24 months, historically driving exponential growth in chip performance and miniaturization.

### ⚙️ Scaling Benefits:

- 🚀 **Increased Speed**
- 🔋 **Reduced Power Consumption**
- 💸 **Lower Cost per Function**
- 🧠 **More Complex Functionality**

### 🧱 Modern Scaling Challenges:

- 🧯 **Power density and thermal limits**
- ⚡ **Sub-threshold leakage**
- 🧬 **Quantum effects at nanoscale**
