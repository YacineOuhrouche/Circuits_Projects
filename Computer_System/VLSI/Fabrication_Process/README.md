## 🧱 Detailed Steps

### 1️⃣ Wafer Preparation
- **Monocrystalline silicon** is grown (e.g., Czochralski process).
- Wafers are sliced (~300–450mm diameter) and polished for fabrication.

---

### 2️⃣ Oxidation
- Grows **SiO₂** on the wafer surface to act as an insulator or gate dielectric.
- Done thermally in oxygen or steam at high temperatures.

---

### 3️⃣ Photolithography
> Transfers microscopic patterns using UV light and photomasks.

- Coat with photoresist → Expose to UV → Develop image.
- Governs **feature resolution**:

---

### 4️⃣ Etching
- Removes unwanted material.
- **Wet Etching**: Chemical etchants like HF for oxides.
- **Dry Etching**: Plasma (e.g., Reactive Ion Etching - RIE).

---

### 5️⃣ Doping (Ion Implantation)
- Bombards the wafer with dopant ions (e.g., boron, arsenic).
- Changes conductivity by forming **P-type** or **N-type** regions.
- Followed by **annealing** to repair lattice damage.

---

### 6️⃣ Deposition
> Adds new material layers.

- **Dielectrics**: SiO₂, Si₃N₄  
- **Metals**: Aluminum, copper  
- Techniques: PVD, CVD, ALD

---

### 7️⃣ Planarization (CMP)
- Ensures flat layers using **Chemical Mechanical Polishing**.
- Enables precise multi-layer stacking in advanced nodes.

---

### 8️⃣ Interconnect Formation
- Adds **metal layers** (often copper) for signal routing.
- **Vias** connect different metal layers vertically.
- Uses damascene or dual-damascene processes.

---

### 9️⃣ 🧳 Packaging

> **IC Packaging** is the final step that encases the chip, provides thermal management, and forms electrical connections to the outside world.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- Protects the **die** from physical and environmental damage.
- Provides **electrical I/O connections** to PCB.
- Aids in **thermal dissipation**.

#### 🧩 Common Package Types:
| 🧱 Package       | 🔍 Description                            | 📦 Use Cases                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **DIP (Dual In-line Package)** | Through-hole package with two rows of pins. | Legacy/through-hole circuits     |
| **QFP (Quad Flat Package)**    | Surface-mount with leads on all four sides.  | Consumer electronics             |
| **BGA (Ball Grid Array)**      | Solder balls on the bottom; compact & fast.  | Microprocessors, SoCs            |
| **CSP (Chip-Scale Package)**   | Bare-die size packaging; ultra-compact.      | Mobile, embedded systems         |
| **WLCSP (Wafer-Level CSP)**    | Packaged at wafer level—no dicing required.  | Wearables, IoT devices           |

#### 🔥 Thermal & Electrical Considerations:
- Heat sinks or **thermal vias** for high-power chips.
- Minimized **parasitic inductance** and resistance for high-speed performance.

#### 🧪 Advanced Packaging:
- **3D Stacking**: TSVs (Through-Silicon Vias) enable vertical integration.
- **SiP (System in Package)**: Multiple dies in a single package.
- **Chiplets**: Modular design using interconnected chip components.
