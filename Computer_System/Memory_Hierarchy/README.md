# 💾 Memory Hierarchy & Cache Systems

---

## ✨ Introduction

**Memory Hierarchy** refers to the structured arrangement of different types of memory in a computing system, optimized to balance speed, cost, and capacity. **Cache Systems** play a crucial role in reducing the latency between the CPU and main memory by storing frequently accessed data. This section covers the fundamentals of memory hierarchy, cache types (L1, L2, L3), and advanced concepts such as paging, segmentation, virtual memory, and memory mapping techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose of Memory Hierarchy & Cache

- **Speeds Up Memory Access**: Cache systems provide faster access to frequently used data.
- **Optimizes Performance**: Hierarchical memory systems ensure optimal use of different memory types.
- **Reduces Latency**: Faster access to data improves overall system performance, particularly in CPUs and GPUs.

## 🧩 Key Components of Memory Hierarchy & Cache

### 1️⃣ **Cache Memory (L1, L2, L3)**

> Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located between the CPU and main memory. It stores frequently used data to reduce the time it takes to access data from main memory.

#### **L1 Cache**
- 🧠 **Location**: Directly on the CPU core.
- ⚡ **Speed**: Fastest but smallest.
- 🏷️ **Size**: Typically 16KB to 128KB.
- 🔄 **Access Time**: Very low latency.

#### **L2 Cache**
- 🧠 **Location**: On the CPU chip but shared across cores.
- ⚡ **Speed**: Slower than L1 but faster than main memory.
- 🏷️ **Size**: Typically 128KB to 12MB.
- 🔄 **Access Time**: Low latency.

#### **L3 Cache**
- 🧠 **Location**: Shared across multiple CPU cores (found in multi-core processors).
- ⚡ **Speed**: Slower than L1 and L2 but larger.
- 🏷️ **Size**: Typically 2MB to 64MB.
- 🔄 **Access Time**: Relatively higher latency than L1 and L2.

| Cache Level | Location         | Size (Typical)  | Speed   | Access Time  |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| **L1**      | On CPU Core      | 16KB to 128KB   | Fastest | Very Low     |
| **L2**      | On CPU Chip      | 128KB to 12MB   | Fast    | Low          |
| **L3**      | Shared Across Cores | 2MB to 64MB  | Slowest | Higher Latency|

### 2️⃣ **Paging**

> Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory and thus eliminates fragmentation. It divides virtual memory into blocks of physical memory called "pages."

#### **Page Table**
- Stores the mapping between virtual addresses and physical memory addresses.
- Maps virtual pages to physical pages.

#### **Page Size**
- Typical sizes: 4KB, 8KB, or larger (based on system architecture).
- Small pages provide more flexibility but increase overhead.

| **Page Size** | **Advantages**                     | **Disadvantages**                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 4KB           | Fine granularity, better memory use | Increased page table overhead              |
| 8KB           | Reduced overhead, fewer pages      | Coarser granularity, less efficient memory use|

### 3️⃣ **Segmentation**

> Segmentation divides the memory into segments based on the logical divisions of a program such as code, data, and stack. Each segment can grow or shrink independently.

#### **Advantages of Segmentation**
- Easier to manage logically related data (code, data, stack).
- Supports variable-sized segments.
- Enables efficient dynamic memory allocation.

#### **Disadvantages of Segmentation**
- Potential external fragmentation.
- Requires additional hardware support.

| **Segment Type** | **Description**                                     | **Example**           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Code**         | Stores executable code                              | Text segment          |
| **Data**         | Stores program variables and constants              | Initialized data      |
| **Stack**        | Stores runtime data like function calls and locals  | Stack memory          |

### 4️⃣ **Virtual Memory**

> Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes that may not be completely in memory, enabling larger programs to run on systems with less physical memory.

#### **Swap Space**
- Virtual memory uses swap space on disk when the physical RAM is full.

#### **Page Fault**
- Occurs when a program accesses data not currently in memory, causing a delay while the data is loaded from disk.

#### **Advantages**
- Enables larger programs than physical memory alone.
- Provides memory isolation between processes.

| **Virtual Memory Feature** | **Advantages**                                        | **Disadvantages**                                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Paging**                 | Efficient memory usage, no fragmentation             | Overhead for managing page tables and swapping data      |
| **Swapping**               | Allows larger programs to run than available RAM     | Slow performance due to disk I/O delays                   |

### 5️⃣ **Memory Mapping**

> Memory mapping refers to mapping a file or device into the virtual address space, enabling processes to access files directly as if they were part of the main memory.

#### **Types of Memory Mapping**
- **File Mapping**: Used for mapping files into memory.
- **Device Mapping**: Maps hardware device registers or buffers into memory space.

#### **Benefits**
- Efficient access to large files or device buffers.
- Direct memory access speeds up file and device operations.

| **Memory Mapping Type** | **Use Case**                                           | **Benefits**                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **File Mapping**        | Access large files, databases, or shared memory areas | Faster file access and processing  |
| **Device Mapping**      | Interfacing with hardware devices                     | Low-latency device interactions    |
