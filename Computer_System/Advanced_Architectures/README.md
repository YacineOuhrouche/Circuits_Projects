## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ **System-on-Chip (SoC)**

> An integrated circuit that consolidates all components of a computer or system into a single chip.

- 🧩 Includes CPU, GPU, memory, I/O interfaces, and more.
- 🔌 Common in smartphones, tablets, embedded devices.
- 🌱 Reduces power, space, and cost.

| Component      | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| CPU            | Main processor                             |
| GPU            | Handles graphics or parallel tasks         |
| RAM/ROM        | On-chip memory                             |
| I/O Interfaces | UART, SPI, I2C, USB, GPIO, etc.            |
| Peripherals    | Camera, audio, wireless, timers, etc.      |

### 2️⃣ **Embedded Systems**

> A specialized computing system that performs dedicated functions within a larger system.

- ⚙️ Often runs a single task continuously.
- 📦 Found in appliances, vehicles, industrial machines.
- 💾 Can be bare-metal or run an RTOS.

| Type                  | Example Devices                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Standalone            | Microwave, digital watch             |
| Real-time             | Anti-lock braking systems (ABS)      |
| Networked             | Smart thermostats, IoT sensors       |
| Mobile Embedded       | Smartphones, tablets                 |

### 3️⃣ **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**

> A lightweight OS designed to guarantee timely task execution.

- ⏱ Ensures deterministic behavior (hard or soft real-time).
- 📋 Supports task scheduling, semaphores, and inter-task communication.
- ⚖️ Used in robotics, avionics, medical systems.

| Feature             | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Preemptive Scheduling** | Ensures high-priority tasks run first |
| **Determinism**     | Predictable response times                 |
| **Low Latency**     | Fast interrupt handling and task switching |
| **Task Management** | Multitasking with priorities               |

### 4️⃣ **Special-Purpose Processors**

> Processors designed for a narrow set of tasks, offering superior performance or efficiency.

- 🎮 **DSPs (Digital Signal Processors)**: Audio, video, radar.
- 🎯 **TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)**: AI/ML acceleration.
- 🧠 **FPGAs/ASICs**: Reconfigurable or custom hardware.

| Processor Type | Focus Area                        | Example Use Case                   |
|----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| DSP            | Signal processing                  | Audio compression, FFT             |
| TPU            | Machine learning inference         | Neural network acceleration        |
| FPGA           | Custom logic (reprogrammable)      | High-speed networking              |
| ASIC           | Fixed-function hardware            | Bitcoin mining, hardware codecs    |
