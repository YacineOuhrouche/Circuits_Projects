# üß© Multicore and Parallel Architectures

---

## ‚ú® Introduction

Modern computing systems increasingly rely on **multicore and parallel architectures** to deliver higher performance, energy efficiency, and support for parallel workloads. These architectures enable multiple processing elements‚Äîeither in the form of cores, threads, or vector units‚Äîto work simultaneously on different tasks or parts of a task.

This section covers key parallel paradigms like **multicore CPUs**, **SIMD/MIMD**, **parallel processing models**, and **GPU architectures**.
