# 🚪 CMOS NOR Gate Using PMOS & NMOS Transistors

Welcome to the **CMOS NOR Gate** project! This folder contains everything related to building and simulating a **2-input NOR gate** using complementary MOS transistors (CMOS technology).

## 📝 What It Does

A **CMOS NOR gate** outputs **LOW (0)** if **any input is HIGH (1)**.  
It only outputs **HIGH (1)** when **both inputs are LOW (0)**.

| A | B | Y (Output) |
|--|--|--|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

## ⚙️ How It Works

This CMOS NOR gate uses:

✅ **Two PMOS transistors** in **series** for the pull-up network (to VDD)  
✅ **Two NMOS transistors** in **parallele** for the pull-down network (to GND)  

### Operation

- If both inputs `A` and `B` are **LOW**, both PMOS transistors turn **ON** and pull the output **HIGH**.
- If either input is **HIGH**, at least one NMOS transistor turns **ON** and pulls the output **LOW**.
- This complementary action achieves low static power consumption — a major advantage of CMOS.
